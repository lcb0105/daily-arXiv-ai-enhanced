TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义框架的方法，用于从电子医疗记录中识别基于性别的暴力事件，在2100万句巴西葡萄牙语语料上验证，识别精度达到0.726。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗记录中基于性别的暴力事件漏报问题，提高公共卫生监测能力。

Method: 使用语义框架定义细粒度模式，在电子医疗记录的无结构文本字段中进行搜索识别。

Result: 定义了8个模式，在2100万句语料中识别暴力报告，经语言学家手动评估，整体精度为0.726。

Conclusion: 该方法透明、高效、低碳且语言无关，可轻松适应其他健康监测场景，促进NLP在公共卫生系统中的伦理和可解释使用。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

Abstract: Clinical documentation increasingly uses automatic speech recognition and
summarization, yet converting conversations into actionable medical orders for
Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can
significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact
downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first
challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six
teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of
approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In
this paper, we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking,
and participants' solutions.

### [3] [Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27037)
*Shang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为弹性语言模型（ELM）的新型神经架构搜索方法，专门针对紧凑语言模型进行优化，通过引入灵活的搜索空间和动态模块来提高搜索效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型预训练语言模型在自然语言理解任务中变得越来越重要，其巨大的计算和内存需求引发了经济和环境方面的担忧，需要开发更高效的紧凑模型。

Method: ELM扩展了现有的NAS方法，引入了具有高效transformer块和动态维度及头数调整模块的灵活搜索空间，并提出了新颖的知识蒸馏损失来保持每个块的独特特征。

Result: 在掩码语言建模和因果语言建模任务上的实验表明，ELM发现的模型显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ELM方法通过改进的搜索空间和知识蒸馏技术，能够更有效地发现高性能的紧凑语言模型架构。

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

### [4] [Dataset Creation and Baseline Models for Sexism Detection in Hausa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27038)
*Fatima Adam Muhammad,Shamsuddeen Muhammad Hassan,Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了首个豪萨语性别歧视检测数据集，通过社区参与、定性编码和数据增强方法构建，并探索了传统机器学习与预训练多语言模型在豪萨语性别歧视检测中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台助长了各种形式的性别歧视，而现有性别歧视检测方法主要针对高资源语言，低资源语言如豪萨语由于语言资源有限和文化差异，检测进展缓慢。

Method: 通过两阶段用户研究（n=66）收集本地说话者对性别歧视的定义和表达，结合社区参与、定性编码和数据增强构建数据集，实验传统机器学习分类器和预训练多语言模型，评估少样本学习效果。

Result: 研究发现在捕捉文化细微差别方面存在挑战，特别是在寻求澄清和习语表达方面，这些情况下容易出现许多误报。

Conclusion: 豪萨语性别歧视检测面临文化细微差别捕捉的挑战，需要进一步改进模型以处理澄清性问题和习语表达，减少误报率。

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

### [6] [Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049)
*Ponrawee Prasertsom,Andrea Silvi,Jennifer Culbertson,Moa Johansson,Devdatt Dubhashi,Kenny Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

### [7] [VISTA Score: Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27052)
*Ashley Lewis,Andrew Perrault,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VISTA是一个用于评估对话事实性的框架，通过声明级验证和序列一致性跟踪来检测多轮对话中的幻觉问题，相比现有方法在多个基准测试中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性评估指标要么评估孤立回复，要么将不可验证内容视为错误，限制了在多轮对话中的应用。幻觉（生成与可用证据或对话上下文不符的陈述）仍然是部署对话AI系统的主要障碍。

Method: VISTA框架将每个助手回复分解为原子事实声明，根据可信来源和对话历史进行验证，并对不可验证陈述进行分类（主观、矛盾、缺乏证据或弃权）。

Result: 在8个大语言模型和4个对话事实性基准测试（AIS、BEGIN、FAITHDIAL和FADE）中，VISTA在幻觉检测方面显著优于FACTSCORE和LLM-as-Judge基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过将事实性建模为对话的动态属性，VISTA提供了一个更透明、更符合人类认知的对话系统真实性衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

### [8] [LLM-Centric RAG with Multi-Granular Indexing and Confidence Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27054)
*Xiaofan Guo,Yaxuan Luan,Yue Kang,Xiangchen Song,Jinxu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度内存索引和不确定性估计的置信度控制方法，用于解决复杂知识环境下检索增强生成中的覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对复杂知识环境中检索增强生成存在的覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题，需要一种能够动态索引知识并控制生成置信度的方法。

Method: 构建分层内存结构将知识表示划分为不同粒度级别，实现从局部细节到全局上下文的动态索引和检索；引入不确定性估计机制，在生成过程中显式约束和过滤低置信度路径；优化目标包括生成损失、熵约束和方差正则化。

Result: 在QA准确性、检索召回率、排序质量和事实一致性方面优于现有模型，证明了多粒度索引与置信度控制结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为检索增强生成提供了新的技术路径，并为提高大模型在复杂环境下的可靠性和可控性提供了实践证据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

### [9] [Detecting Data Contamination in LLMs via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27055)
*Michał Zawalski,Meriem Boubdir,Klaudia Bałazy,Besmira Nushi,Pablo Ribalta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDeC是一种通过上下文检测训练数据污染的方法，利用上下文学习对模型性能的影响来区分训练数据中的记忆数据和分布外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要检测和量化大型语言模型中的训练数据污染，特别是识别模型是否记忆了特定训练数据。

Method: 通过测量上下文学习如何影响模型性能来检测污染，发现上下文示例通常会提升未见数据集的置信度，但可能降低训练数据集的置信度（因为干扰了记忆模式）。

Result: CoDeC产生可解释的污染分数，能清晰区分已见和未见数据集，并在未公开训练语料库的开源权重模型中揭示了强记忆证据。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、自动化，且与模型和数据集无关，易于集成到基准评估中。

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合对比蒸馏和噪声鲁棒训练的微调方法，通过冻结骨干模型并转移教师模型的知识边界，提升语义一致性和对齐精度，同时引入噪声扰动和鲁棒优化约束确保模型在噪声输入下保持稳定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在安全对齐和鲁棒性方面的局限性，构建更安全可信的对齐机制。

Method: 采用对比蒸馏与噪声鲁棒训练结合的微调方法，冻结骨干模型，通过蒸馏损失、鲁棒性损失和正则化项的统一优化目标来平衡对齐能力和抗干扰能力。

Result: 在知识转移、鲁棒性和整体安全性方面显著优于现有基线方法，在多个关键指标上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 不仅丰富了参数高效微调的理论体系，还为构建更安全可信的对齐机制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

### [11] [Characterizing Selective Refusal Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27087)
*Adel Khorramrouz,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型安全护栏中的选择性拒绝偏见，发现模型在不同人口统计群体（性别、性取向、国籍、宗教）之间存在不平等的拒绝率，并通过间接攻击验证了这种偏见带来的安全影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全护栏旨在防止恶意用户大规模生成有害内容，但这些措施可能无意中引入或反映新的偏见，导致模型对某些人口统计群体拒绝生成有害内容而对其他群体不拒绝。

Method: 通过分析针对个体和交叉人口统计群体的拒绝率、LLM响应类型以及生成拒绝的长度来探索选择性拒绝偏见，并采用间接攻击方法针对先前被拒绝的群体进行安全影响调查。

Result: 研究结果显示在性别、性取向、国籍和宗教属性上存在选择性拒绝偏见的证据，间接攻击验证了这种偏见带来的额外安全隐患。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要在不同人口统计群体之间实现更公平和鲁棒的安全护栏性能，以确保模型的安全措施不会引入新的偏见或不平等。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

### [12] [Rating Roulette: Self-Inconsistency in LLM-As-A-Judge Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27106)
*Rajarshi Haldar,Julia Hockenmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现使用大语言模型（LLM）作为自然语言生成评估工具存在评分不一致性问题，不同运行中LLM给出的评分可靠性较低，这种方差使得评分几乎随机。研究量化了这种不一致性，并探讨在适当指南下是否仍能有效使用LLM评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成技术的广泛应用，如何正确评估生成质量变得困难。虽然使用大语言模型进行评估比传统的n-gram或基于嵌入的指标更符合人类偏好，但需要验证其评估的可靠性。

Method: 通过实验展示LLM评估者在不同运行中的评分可靠性，量化这种不一致性在不同NLG任务和基准测试中的表现，并研究在适当指南下是否仍能有效使用LLM评估。

Result: LLM评估者在不同运行中给出的评分具有较低的评分者内部可靠性，这种方差使得评分不一致，在最坏情况下几乎随机，难以衡量其判断的实际质量。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM评估存在评分不一致性问题，但通过制定适当的使用指南，仍有可能在自然语言生成评估中有效利用LLM评估者。

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

*Andy Yang,Anej Svete,Jiaoda Li,Anthony Widjaja Lin,Jonathan Rawski,Ryan Cotterell,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transformer语言模型在自回归和概率性生成场景下的表达能力，揭示了自回归和概率性如何改变Transformer的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer表达能力研究主要将其视为语言识别器（接受或拒绝字符串），而实际应用中Transformer是作为语言模型（自回归概率生成字符串）使用的，需要研究这种实际使用场景下的表达能力。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究Transformer语言模型能够表达的概率分布，比较自回归和非自回归、概率性和非概率性情况下的表达能力差异。

Result: 发现使Transformer语言识别器自回归化有时能增加其表达能力，而概率化可能打破非概率情况下的等价关系。

Conclusion: 本文区分了Transformer在作为语言模型这一最常见使用场景下能够表达的函数类型，为理解Transformer的实际表达能力提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

*Mason Shipton,York Hay Ng,Aditya Khan,Phuong Hanh Hoang,Xiang Lu,A. Seza Doğruöz,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了URIEL+语言知识库，通过引入脚本向量、集成Glottolog语言数据库和扩展谱系插补，显著减少了数据稀疏性问题，提高了语言覆盖率和跨语言迁移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URIEL+语言知识库存在数据稀疏性问题，包括缺失特征类型、不完整的语言条目和有限的谱系覆盖，这限制了其在跨语言迁移特别是低资源语言支持方面的实用性。

Method: 1) 为7,488种语言引入脚本向量来表示书写系统属性；2) 集成Glottolog添加18,710种额外语言；3) 为26,449种语言扩展谱系插补，在谱系间传播类型学和脚本特征。

Result: 脚本向量的特征稀疏性减少14%，语言覆盖率增加高达19,015种语言(1,007%)，插补质量指标提高高达33%。在跨语言迁移任务中，某些设置下性能提升达6%。

Conclusion: 这些扩展使URIEL+在多语言研究中更加完整和包容，为低资源语言提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

### [15] [Identifying the Periodicity of Information in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27241)
*Yulin Ou,Yu Wang,Yang Xu,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS)的新方法，用于检测自然语言中信息编码的周期性模式，发现人类语言中存在显著的信息周期性，并识别出超出典型文本结构单元分布的新周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息密度理论的发展，需要探究自然语言在编码信息时表现出的周期性程度。

Method: 采用APS方法，这是一种规范周期性检测算法，能够识别单个文档中惊奇值序列存在的任何显著周期。

Result: 发现相当比例的人类语言表现出强烈的信息周期性模式；识别并验证了超出典型文本结构单元分布的新周期。

Conclusion: 语言中的信息周期性是结构化因素和长距离驱动因素共同作用的结果；该周期性检测方法在LLM生成检测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏叙事连贯性、覆盖领域狭窄且仅测试简单回忆任务，无法有效评估LLMs在需要长期记忆和长上下文推理任务中的能力。

Method: 1) 提出自动生成长达1000万token的连贯多样化对话框架；2) 构建BEAM基准测试；3) 提出LIGHT框架，为LLMs配备长期情景记忆、短期工作记忆和关键事实便签三种记忆系统。

Result: 实验显示，即使具有100万token上下文窗口的LLMs（无论是否使用检索增强）在对话延长时表现下降。而LIGHT框架在不同模型上平均提升3.5%-12.69%的性能，消融研究证实了每个记忆组件的贡献。

Conclusion: LIGHT框架通过模拟人类认知的多记忆系统，有效提升了LLMs在长对话中的记忆能力，为解决长上下文推理挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

*Rajan Agarwal,Aarush Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLINK是一种计算高效的语言注入方法，通过将多语言编码器的句子嵌入对齐到解码器的潜在嵌入空间，改善低资源非拉丁语系脚本在指令调优大语言模型中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的大语言模型在低资源非拉丁语系脚本上表现不佳，主要由于分词器碎片化和弱跨语言耦合问题。

Method: 首先将冻结多语言编码器的句子嵌入通过轻量级对比投影器对齐到解码器潜在嵌入空间的保留位置；然后将该向量扩展为K个软槽，通过最小适配器训练使冻结解码器能够消费该信号。

Result: LLINK显著改善了双语检索性能，在LLM评判的问答评估中，81.3%优于基础模型，63.6%优于直接微调。

Conclusion: 将低资源语言视为一种模态，为轻量级LLM中更强的跨语言对齐提供了实用路径，尽管在数字保真度方面仍有残余弱点。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MedCalc-Eval，这是评估大语言模型医学计算能力的最大基准，包含700多个任务，涵盖基于方程和基于规则的评分系统，并开发了MedCalc-Env强化学习环境来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准主要关注问答和描述性推理，忽视了临床决策中至关重要的定量推理能力，现有数据集如MedCalc-Bench覆盖的计算任务较少且未能反映真实世界计算场景。

Method: 构建包含700多个任务的MedCalc-Eval基准，分为基于方程的计算和基于规则的评分系统两类，涵盖多个医学专科；开发基于InternBootcamp框架的MedCalc-Env强化学习环境，支持多步临床推理和规划。

Result: 在MedCalc-Env环境中微调Qwen2.5-32B模型，在MedCalc-Eval上取得了最先进的结果，在数值敏感性、公式选择和推理鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MedCalc-Eval为评估LLMs的医学计算能力提供了更全面和具有挑战性的基准，MedCalc-Env环境有效提升了模型性能，但单位转换、多条件逻辑和上下文理解仍是待解决的挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and
contextual understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现多语言推理差距主要源于语言理解失败，并提出选择性翻译策略，仅在被检测到理解失败时进行翻译，从而在仅翻译约20%输入的情况下实现接近全翻译的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型在多语言推理任务中存在性能差距，高资源语言表现优于低资源语言。虽然已有研究尝试缩小这一差距，但其根本原因尚未被充分探索。

Method: 通过分析发现多语言推理差距主要源于语言理解失败，即模型无法将多语言输入意义转化为主导语言（英语）。评估多种检测方法后，提出选择性翻译策略，仅在检测到理解失败时进行翻译。

Result: 实验结果表明，选择性翻译能够有效缩小多语言推理差距，在仅翻译约20%输入的情况下，达到接近全翻译的性能水平。

Conclusion: 理解失败是多语言推理差距的主要原因，可以通过检测和选择性缓解来解决。这为理解差距的起源提供了关键见解，并为实现更公平的多语言推理提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

### [20] [A Unified Representation Underlying the Judgment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27328)
*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型使用统一的Valence-Assent Axis（VAA）维度来编码评价判断，该轴将主观价值判断与事实主张统一处理，导致推理过程从公正推断转向目标导向的合理化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索智能系统（包括生物和人工智能）的判断是依赖专门化模块还是统一的领域通用资源，特别是验证大型语言模型中可解码的神经表征是否真正独立。

Method: 通过对多种大型语言模型的研究，识别出主导的评价判断维度VAA，并通过直接干预实验验证该统一表征的功能。

Result: 发现VAA作为控制信号引导生成过程构建与其评价状态一致的合理化解释，即使牺牲事实准确性，这一机制被称为"推理从属化"。

Conclusion: 该发现为系统性偏见和幻觉提供了机制性解释，揭示了促进连贯判断的架构如何系统性地削弱忠实推理。

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出TransAlign方法，利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器进行词对齐，在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移中显著优于现有词对齐和非词对齐标签投影方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数世界语言缺乏大规模训练数据，基于翻译的跨语言迁移策略需要词对齐进行标签投影，但现有方法性能有限。

Method: TransAlign方法利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器进行词对齐，替代传统的基于mBERT或LaBSE的词对齐器。

Result: TransAlign不仅实现了强大的词对齐性能，在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移中显著优于现有词对齐方法和最先进的非词对齐标签投影方法。

Conclusion: 利用机器翻译模型编码器的词对齐方法在跨语言迁移任务中具有显著优势，为资源匮乏语言的NLP任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThoughtProbe是一个新颖的推理时间框架，利用大型语言模型的隐藏推理特征来提升推理性能，通过分类器指导树结构响应空间探索，并在树扩展后通过分支聚合方法识别最优答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要操纵隐藏表示来引导LLM生成，而本文旨在利用这些隐藏表示作为判别信号，更有效地指导树结构响应空间的探索，以提高推理性能。

Method: 在节点扩展时使用分类器作为评分和排序机制，优先处理高分候选进行延续；完成树扩展后收集所有分支的答案形成候选池；提出分支聚合方法，通过聚合CoT分数在所有支持分支上进行边际化，识别最优答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架的全面探索不仅覆盖了有效推理链，还能有效识别它们，在多个算术推理基准测试中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe框架通过利用LLM的隐藏推理特征和有效的树结构探索机制，显著提升了推理性能，证明了其在算术推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中奖励模型的偏见问题，特别关注前缀偏见——即查询前缀的微小变化会引发模型偏好的系统性偏移。研究发现奖励模型在种族和性别维度存在显著偏见，并提出了一种数据增强策略来缓解这些偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多公开的偏好数据集提供响应对的比较，但由此训练出的奖励模型中潜在的偏见问题尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在检测和评估LLM奖励模型中的前缀偏见，揭示其在公平性方面的问题。

Method: 引入新颖的方法来检测和评估前缀偏见，包括开发偏见度量指标，并在多种开源偏好数据集和奖励模型架构上进行全面评估。同时提出数据增强策略来减轻偏见影响。

Result: 研究发现奖励模型在种族和性别维度存在显著的前缀偏见，且无论底层模型架构如何都容易受到此类偏见影响。提出的数据增强策略有效减少了前缀偏见的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发公平可靠的奖励模型时，需要采用偏见感知的数据集设计和评估方法，为AI公平性的广泛讨论做出贡献。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出IntAttn-Edit方法，通过联合更新MLP和注意力模块来改进知识编辑效果，使用知识平衡策略按模块贡献分配更新幅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注MLP模块权重，而忽略了注意力模块在知识存储中的作用，导致残留过时知识和编辑效果受限。

Method: 基于知识定位实验发现注意力模块在知识存储中的重要作用，提出IntAttn-Edit方法将关联记忆范式扩展到联合更新MLP和注意力模块，采用知识平衡策略按模块贡献分配更新幅度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，IntAttn-Edit相比先前方法实现了更高的编辑成功率、更好的泛化能力和更强的知识保持能力。

Conclusion: 注意力模块在知识存储中发挥重要作用，联合更新MLP和注意力模块的知识编辑方法能显著提升编辑效果，平衡策略能在不同设置下保持最佳性能。

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

Abstract: This paper presents Awal, a community-powered initiative for developing
language technology resources for Tamazight. We provide a comprehensive review
of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational
resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address
persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VCORE是一种基于优化理论的token重加权框架，通过约束优化问题重新分配监督信号，解决标准交叉熵损失在长链思维推理中平等对待所有token的问题，从而提升大语言模型的推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失在监督微调中对所有token平等对待，忽视了推理轨迹中不同token的异质贡献，导致监督分配不当和泛化能力弱，特别是在复杂的长形式推理任务中。

Method: 提出VCORE框架，将链式思维监督重新表述为约束优化问题，通过优化理论视角实现跨token的原则性和自适应监督分配，使训练目标更贴近稳健推理泛化的目标。

Result: VCORE在数学和编程基准测试中，在域内和域外设置下均显著优于现有token重加权方法，在Qwen3系列和LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct模型上取得实质性性能提升，并为后续强化学习提供更有效的初始化。

Conclusion: VCORE通过原则性的监督分配方法有效提升了大语言模型的推理能力，为推进LLM推理能力建立了更强的基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的自回归生成范式导致推理性能随测试时间计算扩展不理想，需要过多计算开销但性能提升有限。扩散语言模型能通过单次前向传播并行去噪高效生成多样样本，可减轻自回归生成的计算负担。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成候选中间思维，大语言模型评估这些思维的质量，形成协作推理框架。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，该框架在复杂推理任务中实现了强大的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该协作推理框架为未来研究提供了有前景的方向，能够有效平衡计算效率和推理质量。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

Motivation: 研究计算嵌入与人类语义判断在英语复合词处理中的对齐程度，旨在推进计算心理语言学发展，澄清驱动复合词处理的因素。

Method: 使用爱丁堡联想同义词库的关联强度、BNC频率和LaDEC可预测性度量，计算嵌入衍生的LMD和ST指标，通过Spearman相关性和回归分析评估其与人类判断的关系。

Result: BERT嵌入比GloVe更好地捕捉组合语义，可预测性评分在人类和模型数据中都是语义透明度的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究结果推进了计算心理语言学，阐明了驱动复合词处理的因素，并为基于嵌入的语义建模提供了见解。

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiSparse-AAS是一个结合稀疏注意力、自适应跨度和双线性注意力的新型框架，用于解决Transformer在长文档摘要中的二次复杂度问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了ROUGE分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在文本摘要中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了在长文档上的可扩展性，需要更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出BiSparse-AAS框架，结合稀疏注意力（降低计算成本）、自适应跨度（动态调整注意力范围）和双线性注意力（建模复杂token交互）。

Result: 在CNN/DailyMail和XSum数据集上分别实现了约68.1%和52.6%的平均ROUGE提升，在OpenWebText和Gigaword数据集上保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS通过解决效率、可扩展性和长序列建模问题，为现实世界文本摘要应用提供了统一的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

TL;DR: SQLSpace是一种人类可解释、可泛化、紧凑的文本到SQL示例表示方法，通过最小化人工干预获得，用于评估文本到SQL模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够深入分析文本到SQL模型性能的方法，超越简单的准确率评估，揭示模型在不同维度上的表现差异。

Method: 提出了SQLSpace表示方法，通过三个用例展示其效用：比较不同基准测试的组成、细粒度分析模型性能、通过查询重写提升模型性能。

Result: SQLSpace能够揭示基准测试之间的组成差异，暴露仅凭准确率无法发现的性能模式，并支持查询成功建模。

Conclusion: SQLSpace为文本到SQL任务提供了比原始示例更深入的分析能力，有助于更好地理解和改进模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了以患者为中心的临床摘要新标准，通过混合方法开发框架，评估开源大语言模型在生成患者价值观摘要方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的临床摘要过于关注患者生物学信息，而忽略了患者的偏好、价值观、愿望和关切，无法实现以患者为中心的护理。

Method: 采用混合方法：通过患者和临床医生访谈确定摘要内容标准，制定标注指南，使用5个开源LLM在72个房颤咨询中生成摘要，采用零样本和少样本提示策略。

Result: 患者强调生活方式、社会支持、压力源和护理价值观；临床医生需要简洁的功能、心理和情感背景。Mistral-8B和Llama-3.1-8B在零样本表现最佳，Llama-3.1-8B在少样本表现最佳。模型在完整性和流畅性上与专家相当，但在正确性和以患者为中心方面人类摘要更优。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够生成高质量的患者中心临床摘要，但在正确捕捉患者价值观方面仍需改进，为实现真正的以患者为中心的AI临床摘要提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU是一个新的阿拉伯语方言评估基准，通过手动翻译和改编3K个选择题到五种主要方言，创建了15K个QA对，用于评估大语言模型在阿拉伯方言上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯语和多语言基准主要关注现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，而方言在日常生活交流中广泛使用但评估不足，需要专门的方言评估资源。

Method: 基于MMLU-Redux框架，手动翻译和改编3K个选择题到五种主要方言（叙利亚、埃及、阿联酋、沙特和摩洛哥），覆盖32个学术和专业领域，共15K个QA对。

Result: 评估了19个阿拉伯语和多语言LLM（1B-13B参数），发现不同方言间存在显著的性能差异，揭示了方言泛化能力的持续差距。

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU提供了首个统一的人工策划资源，用于衡量阿拉伯语方言理解能力，促进更包容的评估和未来模型开发。

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在医学领域特定语料库上进行进一步预训练对多语言医疗NLP任务性能的影响，重点关注荷兰语、罗马尼亚语和西班牙语。通过领域自适应显著提升了任务性能，临床领域模型优于通用生物医学领域模型，并观察到跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗应用中，领域特定的自然语言处理工具有限，特别是对于低资源语言。虽然多语言BERT提供了缓解语言差距的潜力，但低资源语言的医疗NLP任务仍未充分探索。

Method: 进行了四个实验来创建医学领域模型：进一步在领域特定语料库上预训练。然后将这些模型在三个下游任务上微调：荷兰语临床笔记中的自动患者筛查、罗马尼亚语和西班牙语临床笔记中的命名实体识别。

Result: 领域自适应显著增强了任务性能。临床领域自适应模型优于更通用的生物医学领域自适应模型。观察到跨语言可迁移性的证据。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了领域自适应和跨语言能力在医疗NLP中的可行性。在低资源语言设置下，这些发现可以为开发多语言医疗NLP系统提供有意义的指导，以缓解训练数据不足并提高模型性能。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

TL;DR: MARAG-R1是一个基于强化学习的多工具RAG框架，通过动态协调多种检索机制来解决传统单一检索器在外部知识获取上的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖单一检索器和固定的top-k选择，限制了对外部知识的全面访问，特别是在需要语料库级推理的任务中。

Method: 采用强化学习训练的多工具RAG框架，配备四种检索工具（语义搜索、关键词搜索、过滤和聚合），通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）学习如何和何时使用这些工具。

Result: 在GlobalQA、HotpotQA和2WikiMultiHopQA上的实验表明，MARAG-R1显著优于强基线方法，在语料库级推理任务中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: MARAG-R1通过动态协调多种检索机制，有效解决了传统RAG系统的局限性，为语料库级推理任务提供了更全面和精确的信息访问能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: SpecAttn是一种无需训练的方法，通过利用推测解码中草稿模型已计算的注意力权重来识别重要标记，实现预训练变换器中的高效稀疏注意力，减少75%以上的键值缓存访问，仅增加15.29%的困惑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时面临显著的计算瓶颈，特别是随着上下文长度增加，自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为主要问题。

Method: 利用推测解码中草稿模型的注意力权重识别重要标记，采用KL散度层对齐、GPU优化的无排序top-p标记选择算法，以及基于预测的动态键值缓存修剪。

Result: 在PG-19数据集上实现了超过75%的键值缓存访问减少，仅增加15.29%的困惑度，显著优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: 推测执行可以增强为提供近似验证而不会显著降低性能，SpecAttn方法有效解决了LLM推理时的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的效率受限于其顺序的逐词生成过程，需要新的设计维度来突破这一瓶颈，提高每个生成步骤的语义带宽。

Method: 引入连续自回归语言模型（CALM），使用高保真自编码器将K个词元压缩为单个连续向量，并开发无似然框架进行训练、评估和可控采样。

Result: CALM显著改善了性能-计算权衡，以显著更低的计算成本实现了强大离散基线的性能。

Conclusion: 向量预测是构建超高效语言模型的一个强大且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

Motivation: 探索在持续预训练过程中，语言模型是否会像人类认知中的虚幻真相效应一样，因重复接触虚假信息而改变对事实的信念。

Method: 提出了Layer of Truth框架和数据集，通过注入受控数量的污染数据，并在不同检查点、模型规模和问题类型上探测中间表征，量化事实信念何时及如何发生偏移。

Result: 即使最小程度的暴露也能在已确立的事实上诱导持久的表征漂移，易感性在不同层级和模型规模间存在差异。

Conclusion: 持续更新的语言模型存在被忽视的脆弱性：它们会像人类一样内化错误信息，强调在模型更新过程中需要加强对事实完整性的稳健监控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文本和视觉输入联合推理方面表现出色，但对对抗性操作高度脆弱，存在安全和可靠性问题。

Method: 在HuggingFace生态系统中生成对抗图像，然后引入SmoothGuard防御框架：对连续模态（如图像、音频）添加高斯噪声，生成多个候选输出，使用基于嵌入的聚类过滤受对抗性影响的预测，从多数簇中选择最终答案。

Result: 在POPE、LLaVA-Bench和MM-SafetyBench上的广泛实验表明，SmoothGuard提高了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力。消融研究确定了平衡鲁棒性和效用的最佳噪声范围（0.1-0.2）。

Conclusion: SmoothGuard是一个轻量级、模型无关的防御框架，能有效增强多模态大语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，在保持模型效用的同时提供稳定的响应。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临同时确保跨人口群体公平性和保护敏感客户端数据的基本挑战，需要解决隐私与公平之间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入差分隐私公平联邦学习算法FedPF，将多目标优化转化为零和博弈，其中公平性和隐私约束与模型效用竞争。

Result: 实验验证显示在三个数据集上歧视减少高达42.9%，同时保持竞争性准确率，但更重要的是揭示了隐私-公平紧张关系的不可避免性。

Conclusion: 同时实现隐私和公平目标需要精心平衡的妥协，而不是单独优化任一目标，因为更严格的隐私保护会限制系统检测和纠正人口偏见的能力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的级联自适应自推测解码方法（CAS-Spec），通过动态可切换推理加速策略构建推测草案模型，并引入动态树级联算法自适应路由多级草案模型和分配草案长度，实现了最先进的推理加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自推测解码方法虽然集成方便但速度提升有限，而依赖专门训练的方法虽然加速效果好但成本高。级联草案模型层次结构虽有潜力但训练多个模型成本高昂，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用动态可切换推理加速策略（包括层稀疏性和激活量化）构建推测草案模型，并引入动态树级联算法，基于接受率和延迟预测的启发式方法自适应路由多级草案模型和分配草案长度。

Result: CAS-Spec方法在各种LLM和数据集上相比自回归解码实现了1.1倍到2.3倍的平均加速，比级联基线和树状基线算法的平均加速分别提高了47%和48%。

Conclusion: CAS-Spec方法可以轻松集成到大多数现有LLM中，随着自推测解码技术的不断发展，具有进一步加速的潜力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as

*Crystal Su,Kuai Yu,Jingrui Zhang,Mingyuan Shao,Daniel Bauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合本体论与大语言模型的化学工程框架，将结构化领域知识与生成推理相结合，通过数据获取、语义预处理、信息提取和本体映射等步骤生成模板化问答对来指导微调，并使用控制解码和引用门机制确保输出的语法和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号化结构与神经生成相结合，为过程控制、安全分析等关键工程应用提供透明、可审计的LLM应用方法。

Method: 提出本体集成LLM框架，通过数据获取、语义预处理、信息提取、本体映射生成模板问答对进行微调，采用控制解码和引用门机制约束输出，使用语义检索和迭代验证增强系统可解释性和可靠性。

Result: 开发了一个结合结构化领域知识与生成推理的框架，能够量化语言质量和本体准确性，为化学工程领域提供透明可靠的LLM应用方案。

Conclusion: 本体论与LLM的集成为过程控制、安全分析等关键工程场景提供了透明、可审计的方法，通过符号结构与神经生成的结合增强了系统的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

*Kshitij Nikhal,Luke Ackerknecht,Benjamin S. Riggan,Phil Stahlfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合聚类和少样本预测的框架，利用大规模充电需求数据集发现站点原型，原型特定的专家模型在预测未见站点需求方面优于全局基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究受限于小规模数据集、简单的时间依赖建模以及对运营历史有限站点的弱泛化能力，需要准确理解充电行为以支持电动汽车普及和电网弹性基础设施。

Method: 整合聚类与少样本预测的框架，使用新颖的大规模充电需求数据集发现站点原型，建立原型特定的专家模型进行需求预测。

Result: 原型特定的专家模型在预测未见站点需求方面表现优于全局基线模型，为基础设施分割提供预测性能基础。

Conclusion: 通过建立预测性能作为基础设施分割的基础，生成可操作的见解，使运营商能够降低成本、优化能源和定价策略，并支持对气候目标至关重要的电网弹性。

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MM-OPERA基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型的关联智能，包含两个开放任务和11,497个实例，通过定制的LLM-as-a-Judge策略进行开放式输出评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在关联智能方面存在不足，而现有基准测试多为封闭式任务，无法评估开放式关联推理能力，这是人类认知和创造性思维的关键。

Method: 开发了MM-OPERA基准测试，包含远程项目关联和上下文关联两个开放式任务，采用LLM-as-a-Judge策略进行过程奖励知情判断，评估推理路径的精确性。

Result: 通过对最先进LVLMs的广泛实证研究，包括任务实例敏感性分析、评估策略有效性分析和跨能力、领域、语言、文化等的多样性分析，全面揭示了当前LVLMs在关联推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: MM-OPERA基准为评估LVLMs的关联智能提供了系统框架，揭示了当前模型的不足，为开发更类人和通用的人工智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的图灵测试，在原有模仿游戏基础上增加了能量消耗约束，通过效率视角评估智能，将抽象思维问题与有限资源现实联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图灵测试已不足以区分人类和机器智能，先进AI系统已能通过原测试并引发严重伦理和环境问题，迫切需要更新测试标准。

Method: 在原始模仿游戏中增加能量消耗因素作为额外约束，通过效率视角评估智能水平。

Result: 新测试为智能评估提供了可测量的实际终点，迫使社会权衡使用AI的时间节省与其总资源成本。

Conclusion: 基于能量约束的新图灵测试能更有效地评估智能，将抽象思维与有限资源现实联系起来，提供更实用的智能评估框架。

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

### [47] [Predicting Household Water Consumption Using Satellite and Street View Images in Two Indian Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26957)
*Qiao Wang,Joseph George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究利用公开可用的卫星图像、Google街景分割和简单的地理空间数据来预测印度Hubballi-Dharwad地区的家庭用水量，发现这种方法可以接近基于调查的传统方法精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速城市化地区，传统家庭用水监测方法成本高、耗时，需要寻找更高效、低成本的替代方案。

Method: 比较了四种方法：调查特征（基准）、CNN嵌入（卫星、街景、组合）、街景语义地图加辅助数据，在序数分类框架下评估预测效果。

Result: 街景分割加遥感协变量实现了0.55的用水量预测准确率，接近基于调查模型的0.59准确率。在用水量分布的两端具有高精度，但中间类别存在混淆。

Conclusion: 开放获取图像结合最少的地理空间数据，为城市分析中获取可靠的家庭用水量估计提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在有限计算预算下最大化对抗攻击效果的方法，通过选择性重计算层激活来实现细粒度控制，在相同成本下优于现有基线方法，并将对抗训练的计算成本降低到原来的30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限计算资源下如何最大化迭代对抗攻击效果的问题，因为简单地减少攻击迭代次数会显著降低攻击有效性。

Method: 提出细粒度控制机制，在迭代和层级两个维度上选择性重计算层激活，以在约束预算内实现可达到的攻击效果。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在相同成本下持续优于现有基线方法，当集成到对抗训练中时，仅用原始预算的30%就能达到相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为有限计算预算下的AI安全研究提供了有效的解决方案，显著提高了对抗攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

### [49] [HADSF: Aspect Aware Semantic Control for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26994)
*Zheng Nie,Peijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF)，一个两阶段框架，用于解决基于评论的推荐系统中LLM信息提取的冗余、噪声和幻觉问题，通过自适应词汇生成和约束提取来提高推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的评论信息提取方法存在三个主要问题：(i) 无范围控制的自由形式评论挖掘导致冗余和噪声表示；(ii) 缺乏将LLM幻觉与下游有效性联系的原则性指标；(iii) 模型规模间的成本-质量权衡未被充分探索。

Method: HADSF采用两阶段方法：首先通过自适应选择生成紧凑的语料级方面词汇表，然后进行词汇表引导的、显式约束的结构化方面-观点三元组提取。引入了Aspect Drift Rate (ADR)和Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR)来评估表示保真度。

Result: 在约300万条评论和1.5B-70B参数的LLM上的实验表明，当集成到标准评分预测器中时，HADSF能持续减少预测误差，并使较小模型在代表性部署场景中实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: HADSF有效解决了LLM增强可解释推荐中的关键挑战，揭示了幻觉严重程度与评分预测误差之间的非单调关系，为可复现的幻觉感知LLM增强推荐研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

*John J. Vastola,Samuel J. Gershman,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，将学习规则视为在（部分可观测的）损失景观中导航的策略，并将最优规则识别为相关最优控制问题的解。该框架统一解释了梯度下降、动量、自然梯度、非梯度规则和自适应优化器等常见学习规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上学习规则通常是假设而非推导的。该研究旨在理解为什么某些学习规则比其他规则效果更好，以及在什么假设下可以认为给定规则是最优的。

Method: 提出理论框架，将学习规则建模为在部分可观测损失景观中的导航策略，通过最优控制问题来识别最优学习规则。

Result: 在该框架下，梯度下降、动量、自然梯度、非梯度规则和自适应优化器（如Adam）等常见学习规则自然涌现为不同假设下的最优解。持续学习策略如权重重置也可被理解为对任务不确定性的最优响应。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一目标统一了这些现象，阐明了学习的计算结构，并为设计自适应算法提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可复现的多臂老虎机算法评估框架，系统比较了8种经典和方差感知算法，发现在高不确定性环境中方差感知算法表现更好，而在可分离场景中经典算法表现相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多臂老虎机算法评估缺乏标准化条件和可复现性，特别是方差感知扩展算法的性能严重依赖环境条件，需要可靠的方法来观察算法性能差异。

Method: 开发了Bandit Playground代码库，包含明确定义的实验设置、多种性能指标（奖励、遗憾、奖励分布、风险价值、动作最优性）和交互式评估界面。

Result: 方差感知算法在高不确定性环境中具有优势，特别是在臂奖励差异细微的情况下；而在可分离场景中，经典算法经过充分调优后表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 贡献包括：(1) 系统评估MAB算法的框架；(2) 明确了方差感知方法优于经典方法的条件，为算法选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

Result: 在CoinRun案例研究中实现比现有开源实现快一个数量级的复现速度，提供完全可复现的训练流程，支持多样化分片配置。

Conclusion: Jasmine与精选的大规模数据集结合，为跨模型家族和架构消融的严格基准测试流程建立了基础设施，推动了世界建模领域的发展。

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming
data scarcity in domains such as robotics, open training infrastructure for
world modeling remains nascent. We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based
world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of
accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude
faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open
implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading,
training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training
and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated
large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking
pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常通过扩大单个模型规模来提升性能，但计算资源消耗大。本文旨在利用认知多样性概念，通过量化模型间的差异性来战略性地组合预测结果，实现更高效的集成学习。

Method: 应用组合融合分析(CFA)方法，利用秩-分数特征函数量化模型间的不相似性，将基于RoBERTa架构的transformer模型与传统机器学习模型（随机森林、SVM、XGBoost）进行集成。

Result: 在IMDB情感分析数据集上达到97.072%的准确率，优于传统集成方法，且计算资源使用相对高效。

Conclusion: CFA方法通过有效计算和利用模型多样性，能够显著提升情感分类性能，相比扩大单个模型规模的方法更具计算效率优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

### [54] [Quantitative Bounds for Length Generalization in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27015)
*Zachary Izzo,Eshaan Nichani,Jason D. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次为Transformer的长度泛化问题提供了定量边界，分析了不同设置下的泛化条件，证明当Transformer在长序列上的内部行为可以被训练时短序列行为"模拟"时，长度泛化就会发生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明Transformer在训练序列长度超过某个有限阈值后能够实现长度泛化，但该阈值的大小仍然未知。本文旨在量化长度泛化所需的训练长度。

Method: 分析了多种不同问题设置：ℓ∞误差控制与平均误差控制、无限精度softmax注意力与有限精度注意力、单层与双层Transformer。通过证明当长序列内部行为可被短序列行为模拟时泛化发生。

Result: 为Transformer长度泛化提供了首个定量边界，验证了训练数据丰富度与任务复杂性之间的关系，并通过实验验证了理论见解。

Conclusion: 结果加深了对Transformer外推机制的理论理解，并形式化了更复杂任务需要更丰富训练数据才能泛化的直觉。

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）在数学推理任务中的效果，发现在两个组合问题上RLVR虽然改善了评估指标，但主要是通过强化表面启发式方法而非获得真正的推理策略，揭示了RLVR泛化能力的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RLVR在数学推理任务中的真实能力，因为虽然RLVR被证明是增强语言模型推理能力的有前途方法，但其是否真正促进推理过程仍不清楚。

Method: 在具有完全可验证解的两个组合问题（活动调度和最长递增子序列）上应用RLVR，使用精心策划的具有唯一最优解的数据集，并测试多种奖励设计。

Result: RLVR改善了评估指标，但通常是通过强化表面启发式方法而非获得新的推理策略，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了RLVR泛化的局限性，突出了需要能够区分真正数学推理与捷径利用的基准测试，并提供对进展的忠实衡量。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

*Alex Irpan,Alexander Matt Turner,Mark Kurzeja,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出一致性训练方法，通过让模型对提示中的无关线索保持行为不变性，来减少LLM的谄媚行为和越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的事实性和拒绝训练容易受到提示中简单变化的影响，模型经常采纳用户信念（谄媚）或满足包含特殊文本的不当请求（越狱）。

Method: 探索一致性训练范式，包括基于外部输出的BCT方法和基于内部激活的ACT方法，使模型在不同提示增强下行为一致。

Result: 两种方法都降低了Gemini 2.5 Flash对无关线索的敏感性，BCT和ACT在减少谄媚方面效果相当，但BCT在减少越狱方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 一致性训练可以简化训练流程，避免静态数据集的依赖，某些对齐问题应被视为一致性问题而非最优响应问题。

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在克隆检测和程序合成等应用中，需要一个实用且一致的算法相似性度量方法，但现有方法在概念上存在竞争且难以统一。

Method: 引入EMOC（评估-内存-操作-复杂度）框架，将算法实现嵌入到适合下游任务的特征空间中，并编译了PACD数据集进行验证。

Result: EMOC特征支持算法类型的聚类和分类、近重复检测以及LLM生成程序的多样性量化。

Conclusion: EMOC框架为算法相似性分析提供了实用工具，相关代码和数据已发布以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm

Abstract: We present MLPerf Automotive, the first standardized public benchmark for
evaluating Machine Learning systems that are deployed for AI acceleration in
automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in
automotive machine learning systems. Existing benchmark suites cannot be
utilized for these systems since automotive workloads have unique constraints
including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the
domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking
framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols
that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across
different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration
of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object
detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the
methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference
models, and submission rules. We also discuss the first round of benchmark
submissions and the challenges involved in acquiring the datasets and the
engineering efforts to develop the reference implementations. Our benchmark
code is available at https://github.com/mlcommons/mlperf_automotive.

Motivation: 自博弈训练在数学推理中显示出强大效果，但其改进机制尚不清楚。本文旨在深入理解自博弈训练动态，并与RLVR和SFT进行比较分析。

Method: 通过分析参数更新稀疏性、标记分布的熵动态以及替代提议者奖励函数，使用pass@k评估连接训练动态与推理性能。

Result: 研究揭示了自博弈与其他后训练策略的差异，识别了其固有局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果阐明了自博弈训练的工作机制，为其在LLM数学推理中的改进指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的表征学习框架，通过对比学习为颅内电极学习功能身份嵌入，并使用Transformer建模区域间关系，实现跨被试的神经数据聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨被试颅内记录聚合的挑战，因为电极数量、位置和覆盖区域差异很大，传统的空间归一化方法无法准确捕捉功能相似性。

Method: 使用孪生编码器和对比目标学习电极的功能身份嵌入，然后通过Transformer对嵌入进行标记化处理，建模区域间关系。

Result: 学习的功能空间支持准确的主体内区分，形成清晰的区域一致簇，并能零样本迁移到未见通道；Transformer能捕获跨区域依赖关系并重建掩码通道。

Conclusion: 该框架为缺乏严格任务结构和统一传感器布局的颅内神经数据提供了大规模跨被试聚合和预训练的可行路径。

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率层次贝叶斯模型，用于从异质性样本的bulk RNA-seq数据中解卷积出细胞类型特异性表达谱和比例，利用高分辨率单细胞参考数据，应用于人类子宫内膜组织月经周期研究。

Motivation: 解决bulk组织RNA测序数据中细胞类型特异性动态被平均化掩盖的问题，特别是在细胞组成发生显著变化的生物学背景下（如月经周期中的子宫内膜组织）。

Method: 开发概率层次贝叶斯模型，利用高分辨率单细胞参考数据，通过贝叶斯推断策略解卷积bulk RNA-seq数据，获得细胞类型比例和细胞特异性基因表达变化。

Result: 模型成功揭示了月经周期不同阶段上皮细胞、基质细胞和免疫细胞比例的动态变化，识别了与子宫内膜功能相关的细胞类型特异性差异基因表达（如分泌期基质细胞中的蜕膜化标志物）。

Conclusion: 该贝叶斯方法对参考数据不匹配和噪声具有鲁棒性，为研究细胞组成动态变化的生物学过程提供了有力工具，在生育和子宫内膜疾病方面具有潜在临床意义。

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Motivation: 离线策略优化在最大化整体期望奖励时可能会无意中放大群体间的奖励差异，导致某些群体比其他群体受益更多，这在资源有限的情况下引发公平性问题。

Method: 提出一个约束离线策略优化框架，将群体间奖励差异约束引入基于离策略梯度的优化过程，使用双重稳健估计器改进训练期间群体奖励差异的估计，并提供策略优化的收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了离线上下文赌博机中的群体公平性问题，通过约束优化框架平衡了整体性能和群体间公平性。

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了GPT-4.1和GPT-5生成的rationales在自动评分中的效用，发现基于essay的评分通常优于基于rationale的评分，但rationale评分在类别不平衡的score 0上表现更好。集成建模显著提升了评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4.1和GPT-5生成的rationales在自动评分中的实际效用，比较基于essay和基于rationale的评分方法的效果差异。

Method: 使用2012年Kaggle ASAP数据中的Prompt 6 essays，分别进行基于essay的评分和基于rationale的评分，并进行多种集成建模分析。

Result: 基于essay的评分QWK更高，但基于rationale的评分在score 0的F1分数上表现更好。集成建模显著提升了评分准确性，essay评分与两种rationale评分的集成达到了最佳效果（QWK=0.870）。

Conclusion: rationales在自动评分中具有特定价值，特别是在处理类别不平衡问题时。集成essay评分和rationale评分可以显著提升整体评分准确性，达到优于文献报道的效果。

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairAD是一种计算高效的公平图聚类方法，通过构建基于代数距离的亲和矩阵来施加公平约束，然后进行图粗化找到代表节点，最后求解约束最小化问题获得公平聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于机器学习模型对某些人口统计群体的不当行为日益受到关注，公平性概念在社区中引起广泛重视，从而推动了图聚类中公平性的研究。公平图聚类旨在将图中的节点划分为k个不相交的簇，使得每个簇中每个受保护群体的比例与整个数据集中该群体的比例一致。

Method: 首先基于代数距离概念构建新的亲和矩阵以施加公平约束，然后对该亲和矩阵执行图粗化过程找到对应k个簇的代表节点，最后求解约束最小化问题获得公平聚类解。

Result: 在修改的随机块模型和六个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，FairAD能够实现公平聚类，同时与最先进的公平图聚类算法相比，速度提升高达40倍。

Conclusion: FairAD是一种计算高效的公平图聚类方法，能够有效平衡聚类质量和公平性要求，在保持公平性的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"E"的适配器，用于改进基于梯度的优化器，使其在达到局部最小值后继续沿损失景观的山谷探索，以寻找更好的局部最小值，从而提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化器在达到局部最小值后停止搜索，但由于损失景观的复杂性，这些点可能不是最低的或具有最佳泛化能力的点。

Method: 为基于梯度的优化器设计了一个适配器"E"，使优化器在达到局部最小值后继续沿损失景观的山谷（损失低且几乎相同的区域）进行探索。

Result: 在大型批次训练场景中，改进后的Lamb优化器（ALTO）将当前最先进优化器的测试准确率平均提高了2.5%。

Conclusion: 这种方法增加了找到更低且更平坦的局部最小值的可能性，这通常与更好的泛化能力相关，为优化算法设计开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出贝叶斯数据调度器（BDS），一种无需攻击模拟的自适应微调阶段防御策略，用于防御大型语言模型微调服务中的有害微调攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御策略通过攻击模拟预先构建鲁棒性，但存在根本性限制：无法扩展到有界威胁模型之外的攻击，以及难以适应变化的攻击设置。

Method: BDS将有害微调防御建模为贝叶斯推断问题，学习每个数据点安全属性的后验分布，并通过从后验中采样的安全属性加权数据来约束微调过程。

Result: 在各种攻击和防御设置下的综合结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BDS通过贝叶斯推断的后验性质实现自适应防御，并引入基于摊销贝叶斯学习的神经调度器，实现高效迁移而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多项式时间算法，用于在线稀疏线性回归问题，该算法在兼容性条件下显著改进了之前的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线稀疏线性回归问题，其中算法在预测时只能访问每个实例的k个属性，这个问题已被证明是NP难的。之前的工作需要数据矩阵满足特征线性独立、兼容性条件或限制等距性质等假设。

Method: 利用Dantzig选择器，结合算法相关的协方差矩阵采样方案、自适应参数调整方案以及具有仔细初始化的批处理在线牛顿步骤等新技术。

Result: 在较弱的兼容性条件下显著改进了之前的遗憾边界，改进得益于估计器ℓ1范数误差的更紧收敛率。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在兼容性条件下实现了更好的性能，并成功扩展到具有额外观测的在线稀疏线性回归问题，进一步改进了之前的遗憾边界。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视虚拟机冷启动、长尾服务时间分布等现实因素，且单一资源配置无法适应不同查询分布，导致资源利用率低下。

Method: 将ML查询建模为遍历无环阶段序列，每个阶段包含稀疏模型参数块，在内部或最终分类器处可能退出。采用FaaS无服务器函数和阶段特定资源分配，结合基于请求摄入的自适应负载均衡。

Result: SERFLOW能够降低云成本超过23%，同时有效适应动态工作负载。

Conclusion: 通过整合阶段特定资源分配和自适应负载均衡，SERFLOW解决了现实世界中的资源分配挑战，显著提升了成本效益和适应性。

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了特征-函数曲率分析（FFCA）框架，通过4维特征签名量化特征的四个关键属性，并扩展到动态原型分析来追踪训练过程中的特征演化，为模型解释提供了几何上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流归因方法通常只提供模型最终状态的静态图片，将特征作用简化为单一分数，无法处理非线性和交互作用，需要更完整的解释框架。

Method: 引入特征-函数曲率分析（FFCA）框架，为每个特征生成包含影响、波动性、非线性和交互作用的4维签名，并扩展到动态原型分析来追踪训练过程中的特征演化。

Result: 首次提供了层次学习的直接经验证据，显示模型总是先学习简单线性效应再学习复杂交互作用；动态分析还能识别模型容量不足和预测过拟合发生。

Conclusion: FFCA通过其静态和动态组件提供了必要的几何上下文，将模型解释从简单的量化转变为对整个学习过程的细致、可信赖的分析。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

Result: 实验结果显示在不变和等变嵌入之间观察到较低的正则相关性，并在各种迁移学习任务中取得一致改进。

Conclusion: STAR方法通过建模投影头为专家来专门化信息捕获，有效减少了冗余特征学习，提高了表示学习效率。

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

*Qiyan Deng,Changqian Zheng,Lianpeng Qiao,Yuping Wang,Chengliang Chai,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于影响力函数的加权蒸馏框架IWD，通过评估数据实例在蒸馏过程中的影响力来区分数据质量，优先选择有益数据并降低无用或有害数据的权重，从而提升蒸馏数据集的质量和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集蒸馏方法通常假设所有真实实例对蒸馏过程的贡献相同，但实际数据集中既包含有用信息也包含冗余甚至有害实例。直接蒸馏整个数据集而不考虑数据质量会降低模型性能。

Method: 提出影响力加权蒸馏(IWD)框架，利用影响力函数显式地考虑数据质量，为每个实例分配基于其对蒸馏目标影响的适应性权重，优先选择有益数据并降低无用或有害数据的权重。该框架具有模块化设计，可无缝集成到多种数据集蒸馏框架中。

Result: 实证结果表明，集成IWD能够提高蒸馏数据集的质量并增强模型性能，准确率提升最高可达7.8%。

Conclusion: IWD框架通过显式考虑数据质量，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的效果，证明了在蒸馏过程中区分数据实例重要性的价值。

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

TL;DR: ECVL-ROUTER是首个面向视觉语言模型(VLMs)的场景感知路由框架，通过动态选择合适模型来平衡响应速度、输出质量和能耗需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户需求在不同场景下差异很大，包括快速响应、高质量输出和低能耗。仅依赖云端大模型会导致高延迟和高能耗，而边缘设备上的小模型能够以低延迟和低能耗处理简单任务。需要充分利用大小模型的优势。

Method: 提出ECVL-ROUTER框架，引入新的路由策略和评估指标，根据用户需求为每个查询动态选择合适模型。构建了专门用于路由器训练的多模态响应质量数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法成功将超过80%的查询路由到小模型，同时问题解决概率下降不到10%。

Conclusion: ECVL-ROUTER框架能够有效平衡模型性能和资源消耗，在保持高质量输出的同时显著降低延迟和能耗。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD性能预测研究的评估协议不一致，大多数工作只覆盖有限数量的真实世界OOD数据集和分布偏移类型，需要提供方便公平的算法比较基准。

Method: 构建ODP-Bench基准，整合常用OOD数据集和现有性能预测算法，提供预训练模型作为测试平台。

Result: 创建了一个全面的基准测试平台，为未来研究者提供一致的比较基础，并通过深入实验分析理解各种算法的能力边界。

Conclusion: ODP-Bench为OOD性能预测领域提供了标准化的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的发展并促进算法间的公平比较。

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

*Berken Utku Demirel,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于互信息分析心率非线性混沌行为的新方法，结合深度学习显著提升了心率估计精度，在真实场景数据上比传统方法提升高达40%，减少了对多模态传感器的依赖和后续处理需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心率振荡具有复杂的非线性混沌特性，这对日常心血管健康监测提出了挑战。现有方法难以有效处理这种非线性时间复杂性，需要开发新的数学方法来解释和改善心率估计。

Method: 通过互信息分析心率的非线性混沌行为，提出了一种新颖的心率估计方法。该方法从数学角度解释和处理非线性时间复杂性，并与深度学习解决方案相结合。

Result: 在四个真实场景数据集上的验证表明，该方法相比传统方法和现有机器学习技术，心率估计性能提升高达40%，同时减少了对多模态传感器的依赖，无需后续处理步骤。

Conclusion: 提出的基于互信息的非线性混沌分析方法有效提升了心率估计性能，为日常心血管健康监测提供了更准确、更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing
machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing
modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

*Philipp Davydov,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge,Elisa Nguyen,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语义新颖性评估方法，通过不可归因性来衡量模型输出是否在预训练语料库中没有语义相似的上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据归因方法关注哪些训练样本影响了特定输出，而本文反转问题：哪些输出无法归因于任何预训练样本，以此作为语义新颖性的操作化定义。

Method: 使用两阶段检索流程：先用轻量级GIST嵌入索引语料库，检索top-n候选，然后用ColBERTv2重新排序。如果最近语料项的可归因性低于人工生成的文本参考，则认为模型输出是新颖的。

Result: 在SmolLM和SmolLM2上的评估显示：(1)模型利用预训练数据的跨度比之前报道的要长；(2)某些领域系统性地促进或抑制新颖性；(3)指令调优不仅改变风格，还增加新颖性。

Conclusion: 围绕不可归因性重新定义新颖性评估，能够在预训练规模上实现高效分析。作者发布了约20TB的语料块和索引工件以支持复现和大规模扩展分析。

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

*Yu-Chen Kuo,Yi-Ju Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedM2T是一个时间感知的多模态框架，专门用于处理医疗数据的多模态性和异质时间结构。它通过稀疏时间序列编码器、分层时间感知融合和双模态注意力机制，在三个临床预测任务上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据具有固有的多模态性和异质时间结构，这给建模带来了重大挑战。需要一种能够灵活处理不规则稀疏时间序列、捕捉多时间尺度模式并提取跨模态交互的框架。

Method: MedM2T整合了三个核心组件：(1)稀疏时间序列编码器处理不规则稀疏时间序列；(2)分层时间感知融合捕捉密集时间序列的微观和宏观时间模式；(3)双模态注意力提取跨模态交互。使用模态特定的预训练编码器并通过对齐特征来缓解模态间的粒度差异。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和MIMIC-IV-ECG数据集上的评估显示，MedM2T在三个任务上表现优异：90天心血管疾病预测（AUROC 0.947，AUPRC 0.706）、院内死亡率预测（AUROC 0.901，AUPRC 0.558）和ICU住院时间回归（MAE 2.31）。

Conclusion: MedM2T展现了强大的鲁棒性和广泛的适用性，在临床预测任务中超越了现有的多模态学习框架和时间序列模型，是一个有前景的临床预测工具。

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at
https://github.com/DHLab-TSENG/MedM2T.

### [78] [Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378)
*Austin Meek,Eitan Sprejer,Iván Arcuschin,Austin J. Brockmeier,Steven Basart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了思维链（CoT）输出的监控能力，提出了将忠实性和详尽性结合为单一监控能力评分的方法，评估了不同模型在多个数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链输出让我们能够观察模型的逐步推理过程，这种可见性有助于发现不安全或未对齐的行为（可监控性），但前提是CoT对其内部推理是透明的（忠实性）。现有方法在测量忠实性方面存在局限，需要更全面的监控能力评估。

Method: 引入详尽性概念——CoT是否列出了解决任务所需的每个因素，将忠实性和详尽性结合为单一监控能力评分，使用Inspect库在BBH、GPQA和MMLU数据集上评估指令调优和推理模型。

Result: 结果显示，模型可能看起来忠实但难以监控（当它们遗漏关键因素时），不同模型家族的监控能力存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 思维链作为模型外部工作记忆的监控能力因模型而异，这对基于CoT监控的安全方案具有重要意义。作者发布了评估代码以支持可复现的未来工作。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

*Arun Jose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于结果强化学习训练的链式思维推理模型的可读性问题，发现RL训练导致推理过程变得难以理解，但最终答案仍保持可读性。模型使用不可读的推理来获得正确答案，且问题难度越大，可读性越差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究链式思维推理模型的可读性和忠实性，以了解模型意图并检测潜在恶意行为。由于基于结果的强化学习训练可能导致推理过程不透明，这可能会削弱监控方法的有效性。

Method: 分析了14个推理模型的链式思维可读性，比较了RL训练前后的变化。通过强制模型仅使用可读部分进行推理来测试准确性变化，并研究了可读性与性能之间的关系。

Result: RL训练导致推理变得难以理解（除Claude外），模型使用不可读推理获得正确答案（强制使用可读部分时准确性下降53%）。可读性与性能在重采样时无相关性，且问题难度越大可读性越差。

Conclusion: 如果没有明确优化可读性，基于结果的强化学习自然会产生推理过程日益不透明的模型，这可能破坏监控方法的有效性。需要进一步研究这种现象的原因，包括隐写术、训练伪影和残留标记等假设。

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

TL;DR: Atlas-Alignment框架通过将未知潜在空间与标记化的人类可解释概念图谱对齐，实现跨语言模型的解释性迁移，无需训练特定稀疏自编码器即可进行语义特征搜索和可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释性方法成本高昂且难以扩展，需要为每个新模型训练特定的稀疏自编码器、手动标记组件并进行验证。

Method: 使用共享输入和轻量级表示对齐技术，将未知潜在空间与预构建的概念图谱对齐，实现语义特征检索和沿概念图谱的可控生成。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，简单的表示对齐方法能够实现稳健的语义检索和可控生成，无需标记概念数据。

Conclusion: Atlas-Alignment通过投资一个高质量概念图谱，以最小边际成本使多个新模型变得透明和可控，从而分摊可解释AI的成本。

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FedMuon优化器来解决联邦学习中的通信瓶颈问题，通过矩阵正交化优化矩阵结构参数，在非IID设置下使用动量聚合和局部-全局对齐技术减少客户端漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的核心瓶颈在于通信轮次，现有方法主要使用逐元素优化器，忽略了权重矩阵的几何结构，导致局部更新中病态方向的放大和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出FedMuon优化器，包含两个关键技术：动量聚合（客户端使用聚合动量进行本地初始化）和局部-全局对齐（将局部梯度与全局更新方向对齐以减少客户端漂移）。

Result: 理论上证明FedMuon实现了线性加速收敛率，无需异质性假设。实验验证在语言和视觉模型上，FedMuon显著减少通信轮次并提高测试准确率。

Conclusion: FedMuon通过矩阵正交化和客户端漂移缓解技术，有效解决了联邦学习中的通信瓶颈问题，在IID和非IID设置下都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

Motivation: 理解野火后植被损失对于制定有效的生态恢复策略至关重要，但现有研究未能充分探索所有影响因素及其相互作用，且预测模型缺乏可解释性，限制了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该研究成果有望为未来的灾害救援规划、生态政策制定和野生动物恢复管理提供信息支持。

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

Method: 使用平滑双射将开放单纯形映射到欧几里得空间，基于Aitchison几何定义映射关系，通过Dirichlet插值将离散观测去量化为连续数据，实现在欧几里得空间中的密度建模。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上取得了具有竞争力的性能，证明了该方法在保持几何结构的同时简化了建模过程。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地在欧几里得空间中实现了对单纯形上概率分布的学习和采样，同时尊重Aitchison几何，为分类数据的建模提供了一种有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

### [85] [DP-FedPGN: Finding Global Flat Minima for Differentially Private Federated Learning via Penalizing Gradient Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27504)
*Junkang Liu,Yuxuan Tian,Fanhua Shang,Yuanyuan Liu,Hongying Liu,Junchao Zhou,Daorui Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的客户端级差分隐私联邦学习算法DP-FedPGN，通过引入全局梯度范数惩罚来寻找全局平坦最小值，缓解差分隐私导致的模型泛化性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前客户端级差分隐私联邦学习方法会导致更尖锐的损失景观，降低模型泛化能力。现有的SAM方法只能找到局部平坦最小值，无法反映全局平坦性。

Method: 在DP-FedPGN中引入全局梯度范数惩罚到局部损失函数中，寻找全局平坦最小值，同时减少局部更新范数，降低梯度裁剪误差。

Result: 在ResNet和Transformer模型上的六个视觉和自然语言处理任务中，相比现有最先进算法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN不仅找到了更平坦的全局最小值，还减少了局部更新范数，同时消除了数据异构性的影响并实现了快速收敛。

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列基础模型在脑电图（EEG）任务中的应用，发现即使使用非神经来源数据或合成信号进行预训练，通用时间序列基础模型也能有效迁移到EEG分析中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时间序列基础模型在生物医学信号（如脑电图）领域的适用性，特别是验证这些通用模型在EEG任务中的表现。

Method: 使用两种预训练策略：（a）在多个领域的真实世界时间序列上进行预训练；（b）在纯合成数据上进行预训练。在EEG任务（如运动想象分类和睡眠阶段预测）上测试模型性能。

Result: 两种预训练变体都表现出色，一致优于广泛使用的卷积基线EEGNet和最新的EEG专用基础模型CBraMod。

Conclusion: 通用时间序列基础模型，即使使用非神经来源数据或合成信号进行预训练，也能有效迁移到EEG分析中，表明EEG领域可以从更广泛的时间序列文献进展中受益。

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于基于群体的结构健康监测（PBSHM）的贝叶斯领域自适应框架，结合主动学习策略，可在标签稀缺情况下提高分类模型的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构健康监测系统的训练数据获取成本高且不切实际，特别是标记数据。虽然基于群体的SHM可以利用多结构数据，但不同结构的数据分布差异会导致泛化误差。现有方法主要关注无监督领域自适应，未考虑在线框架和标记目标数据的整合。

Method: 提出贝叶斯领域自适应框架，利用有限标记目标数据改进无监督DA映射，并集成主动采样策略指导检查选择最具信息量的观测进行标记。

Result: 在实验桥梁群体上的评估表明，结合迁移学习和主动学习可在标签稀缺场景中提高分类模型的数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构的数据驱动运维提供了启示，表明可以在结构运营寿命期间减少检查次数，从而降低运营成本。

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TetraJet-v2是一种端到端的4位全量化训练方法，使用NVFP4格式处理所有线性层中的激活、权重和梯度，解决了权重振荡和异常值问题，显著缩小了与全精度训练的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练成本极高，推动了对低精度全量化训练的研究。虽然4位格式如NVFP4提供了显著的效率提升，但在如此低精度下实现近乎无损的训练仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出TetraJet-v2方法，包括：1）用于NVFP4线性层的无偏双块量化方法；2）抑制权重振荡的OsciReset算法；3）保持异常值精度的OutControl算法。

Result: TetraJet-v2在预训练LLM中持续优于先前的FP4训练方法，模型规模达370M，数据规模达200B tokens，将性能差距缩小了平均51.3%。

Conclusion: TetraJet-v2通过解决权重振荡和异常值问题，有效实现了4位全量化训练，显著提升了低精度训练的性能，为大语言模型的高效训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在金融领域应用时面临的关键挑战：专有数据集访问受限、检索准确性有限、监管约束以及敏感数据解释问题。

Method: 采用混合检索策略整合开源和专有金融数据，使用动态提示框架实时适应查询复杂度，提出四层任务分类，并集成多层安全机制和实时合规监控。

Result: 评估了三种数据集成技术（上下文嵌入、小模型增强、定向微调），分析了它们在不同金融环境下的效率和可行性。

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA框架通过自适应方法和严格的安全协议，为金融问答系统提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理多样化的金融查询并确保监管合规。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

TL;DR: 提出了ORGEval框架，使用图论方法评估LLMs在优化问题建模中的能力，通过将优化模型表示为图并检测图同构来解决现有求解器方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用中优化问题建模需要大量人工和领域知识，现有基于求解器的评估方法存在不一致性、不可行性和高计算成本问题，需要更稳健的评估指标。

Method: 将优化模型表示为图，将等价性检测简化为图同构测试。提出对称可分解图的充分条件，在此条件下Weisfeiler-Lehman测试能正确检测同构。结合定制WL测试和SD检测算法评估模型等价性。

Result: ORGEval能成功检测模型等价性，在随机参数配置下产生100%一致结果，在运行时间上显著优于基于求解器的方法，特别是在困难问题上。构建了Bench4Opt数据集，发现DeepSeek-V3和Claude-Opus-4在直接提示下准确率最高。

Conclusion: ORGEval为评估LLMs在优化建模能力提供了有效的图论框架，虽然优化建模对所有LLMs仍具挑战性，但某些模型在直接提示下表现优异。

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了panprediction框架，将模型训练视为从数据中提取足够信息，以便模型可用于最小化下游任务中的多种损失函数。该框架统一了omniprediction和多组学习，并在温和假设下证明同时最小化无限多任务上的无限多损失在统计上可能与单一任务单一损失同样容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习关注在固定分布上最小化固定损失函数，而新兴范式认为模型训练应提取足够信息，使模型能够用于最小化下游任务中的多种损失。本文旨在形式化这一范式并研究其统计复杂性。

Method: 设计了学习确定性和随机化panpredictor的算法，分别需要$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$和$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$样本。关键技术是将panprediction近乎无损地简化为统计高效的概念——步校准(step calibration)。

Result: 在温和假设下，同时最小化无限多任务上的无限多损失在统计上可能与单一任务单一损失同样容易。改进了确定性omniprediction的最佳已知样本复杂度保证，因子为$1/\varepsilon$，并匹配了omniprediction和多组学习的其他已知样本复杂度保证。

Conclusion: panprediction框架统一并推广了omniprediction和多组学习，证明了在适当条件下，同时处理多个损失和多个任务在统计上是可行的，且复杂度可控。

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基本挑战，通常导致不可靠的分类性能。现有方法主要关注数据或损失重加权方案，而本文从不同视角看待不平衡问题，认为不平衡会通过少数类别的未指定性放大Clever Hans效应。

Method: 采用基于反事实解释的可解释AI方法，联合识别和消除在类别不平衡条件下出现的Clever Hans效应。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种被现有方法忽视的视角，展示了如何利用可解释AI来解决类别不平衡问题，特别是通过识别和消除Clever Hans效应来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

Conclusion: 开放环境对信用分配提出了新的挑战，需要开发能够适应动态变化的信用分配方法。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

*Michael Kleinman,Matthew Trager,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自适应努力控制方法，通过强化学习训练模型使用用户指定的相对思考token比例，实现动态成本-准确性权衡控制，无需数据集特定调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要用户预先指定绝对token数量，但用户难以事先知道问题难度来设置合适的token预算。需要更细粒度的控制来平衡输出质量与延迟成本。

Method: 自适应努力控制方法，使用强化学习训练模型根据用户指定的相对思考token比例（相对于当前平均思维链长度）来分配推理资源。

Result: 在1.5B到32B参数规模的模型上，该方法能实现约3倍的思维链长度减少，同时保持或提升相对于RL训练基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了数据集和阶段特定调优需求，相比标准方法产生更好的成本-准确性权衡曲线，用户可通过连续努力参数动态调整权衡。

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了大型语言模型在数学证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和部分分数分配，并提出了一种基于智能体工作流程的自动评分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SOTA LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估这些模型在证明评分方面的能力，特别是检测错误、判断严重性和分配合理分数，而不仅仅是二元正确性判断。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，引入智能体工作流程来提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，并进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能够可靠地标记错误（包括细微错误）解决方案，但在部分分数分配方面存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人类评分一致性和部分分数处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的智能体工作流程能够提高与人类评分的一致性，并在部分分数处理方面更加一致，为未来的数学证明自动评分研究提供了有价值的工具和数据。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种奖励机器（RM）的泛化形式来解决长视野问题中无序子任务的学习效率问题，并引入了基于耦合RM的组合学习算法CoRM，实验证明其在处理无序子任务的长视野问题上优于现有RM算法。


<details>

Motivation: 传统奖励机器在处理长视野问题中无序子任务时存在局限性，因为无序子任务的数量增加会导致需要学习的信息呈指数级增长，这限制了RM在实际复杂任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了三种RM泛化形式：数值RM、议程RM和耦合RM，并开发了基于耦合RM的组合学习算法CoRM，通过状态耦合和议程跟踪来高效处理无序子任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoRM算法在长视野问题中处理无序子任务时，比现有最先进的RM算法具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过引入耦合RM和相应的组合学习算法，有效解决了传统RM在处理无序子任务长视野问题时的可扩展性限制，为复杂任务的学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

Motivation: 传统过程发现方法不考虑执行结果差异，导致模型在合规性检查和性能分析方面表现不佳。区分理想与不理想过程执行（如效率、合规性差异）为结果导向的过程发现提供了机会。

Method: 通过学习控制流特征上的可解释判别规则，将具有相似理想性特征的轨迹分组，并在每个组内分别应用过程发现技术。

Result: 该方法已在多个真实事件日志上评估，证明能有效隔离和可视化关键过程模式，并已实现为公开可用工具。

Conclusion: 结果感知的过程发现方法能生成更聚焦和可解释的模型，揭示理想和不理想执行的关键驱动因素，优于不考虑结果差异的单模型方法。

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Motivation: 重新评估LLM在数学发现中的贡献，特别是针对之前报道中LLM遗传算法为均匀分布和Weibull分布下的在线装箱问题产生新启发式算法的说法。

Method: 详细分析LLM生成的启发式算法行为与可解释性，提出针对特定装箱问题实例的新算法类别，并与LLM生成的算法进行比较。

Result: 发现LLM生成的启发式算法虽然人类可读但对领域专家仍不透明，提出的新算法更简单、高效、可解释且泛化性更好，表明所考虑的装箱问题实例本身相对简单。

Conclusion: LLM对该问题的贡献存在局限性，基于错误假设认为这些实例已被研究过，强调评估LLM生成输出的科学价值时需要严谨验证和情境化分析。

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合视觉和运动约束的多智能体强化学习框架来模拟行人-驾驶员交互，在真实世界无信号人行横道数据集上验证，显示结合两种约束的模型表现最佳，能生成更真实的人类行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于规则的逻辑、博弈论或黑盒机器学习，缺乏灵活性且忽略了感知和运动约束等底层机制，这些机制塑造了行人和驾驶员在交互场景中的感知和行为方式。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习框架，集成行人和驾驶员智能体的视觉和运动约束，评估四种模型变体（无约束、仅运动约束、仅视觉约束、两者结合），在真实世界无信号人行横道数据集上进行测试。

Result: 结合视觉和运动约束的模型表现最佳，运动约束产生更平滑的运动，类似人类在穿越交互中的速度调整；视觉约束引入感知不确定性和视野限制，使智能体表现出更谨慎和可变的行为；在数据有限情况下优于监督行为克隆模型。

Conclusion: 多智能体强化学习结合人类约束是模拟真实道路用户交互的有前景的建模方法，通过将控制人类约束的参数建模为群体级分布来考虑个体差异，这是先前行人-车辆交互建模工作中未探索的视角。

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

TL;DR: DeepCompress是一个新颖框架，通过自适应长度奖励机制同时提升大型推理模型的准确性和效率，针对简单问题鼓励短推理路径，对困难问题促进长推理链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在认知效率问题：对简单问题"过度思考"，对复杂问题"思考不足"。现有方法使用监督微调或带令牌长度奖励的强化学习来提高效率，但往往以牺牲准确性为代价。

Method: DeepCompress采用自适应长度奖励机制，基于模型演化能力实时将问题动态分类为"简单"或"困难"，对简单问题鼓励更短、更高效的推理，对困难问题促进更长、更具探索性的思维链。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，DeepCompress始终优于基线方法，在显著提高令牌效率的同时实现了更优的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架使模型能够自主调整其思维链长度，压缩已掌握问题的推理过程，并扩展其认为具有挑战性问题的推理过程，从而同时提升准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在数学几何推理方面面临高质量几何数据稀缺的挑战，现有合成几何数据方法生成的数据缺乏多样性且偏离真实几何图形。

Method: 使用形式语言在度量空间中探索条件组合，通过符号引擎确保生成几何问题的正确性，生成与原始问题不同但正确的高保真几何问题。

Result: 使用GeoFM合成数据训练的模型在MathVista几何问题解决任务上比GPT-4o高出18.7%，在GeoQA上高出16.5%；在开源模型上分别高出5.7%和2.7%。

Conclusion: GeoFM方法能够生成高质量、多样化的几何数据，显著提升多模态大语言模型在几何推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: 多智能体按需知识集成显著提高了推理准确性和效率，为复杂知识密集型问题解决提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在硬件描述语言生成中面临参数知识有限和领域特定约束的挑战，而多智能体方法存在噪声传播和推理空间受限的问题。

Method: 提出VeriMoA框架，包含两个创新：1）质量引导缓存机制，维护所有中间HDL输出并进行质量排序选择；2）多路径生成策略，利用C++和Python作为中间表示，将规范到HDL的翻译分解为两阶段过程。

Result: 在VerilogEval 2.0和RTLLM 2.0基准测试中，VeriMoA实现了15-30%的Pass@1提升，特别是使较小模型能够匹配较大模型和微调替代方案，无需昂贵训练。

Conclusion: VeriMoA通过协同创新有效解决了多智能体方法的局限性，为硬件设计自动化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

TL;DR: BEAT是首个针对MLLM驱动的具身智能体的视觉后门攻击框架，使用环境中的物体作为触发条件，当触发物体出现时，智能体会持续执行攻击者指定的多步策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型驱动的具身智能体通过视觉输入直接感知、推理和规划任务导向动作，但这也开启了新的攻击面——视觉后门攻击，智能体在正常情况下表现正常，一旦场景中出现视觉触发器就会执行攻击者指定的策略。

Method: BEAT通过(1)构建跨越多样化场景、任务和触发器放置的训练集来暴露智能体到触发器变异性，(2)引入两阶段训练方案：先进行监督微调(SFT)，然后使用新颖的对比触发器学习(CTL)，将触发器判别建模为触发存在和触发缺失输入之间的偏好学习，明确锐化决策边界以确保精确的后门激活。

Result: 在各种具身智能体基准测试和MLLMs上，BEAT实现了高达80%的攻击成功率，同时保持强大的良性任务性能，并能可靠地泛化到分布外的触发器放置。与朴素SFT相比，CTL在有限后门数据下将后门激活准确率提升高达39%。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了基于MLLM的具身智能体中一个关键但未被探索的安全风险，强调了在现实世界部署前需要强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

Conclusion: Agentic AI的成功关键在于验证，而非基础模型的选择；LLMs只是实现验证的选项之一，验证才是真正需要的核心要素。

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.
