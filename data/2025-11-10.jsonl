This paper examines the interplay between\nKV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like\nmeta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of\npositional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking\nframework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the\naccumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window\n(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory\nexhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via\nAttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.\nBecause LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a\ncache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to\ndegenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving\ncontiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more\ncoherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate\nfor eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional\nstructure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size."}

Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including\nLayer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues\nthat drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression\nfrom suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned\ntransformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,\nwhile also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and\nhuman-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as\na lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental\nhealth platforms."}

To overcome the\nchallenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose\nWinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy\ndocuments while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as\nwinnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware\nclustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each\ncluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage\nII, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of\nmultiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To\nretain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic\nmerging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for\ngenerating the final response.

To overcome the\nchallenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose\nWinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy\ndocuments while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as\nwinnowing.

Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise).

To address these issues, we propose two distinct and\ncomplementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging\nenvironment-specific information available during deployment.

We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,\nincluding function calling and web navigation.

This process is combined with further training\nusing a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be\nreduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a\n9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that\nthe middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the\npotential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making\nthe approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings."}

To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid\nframework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and\nPELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep\nlearning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot\nprices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and\npolicy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate\ndatasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing\nforecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by\n70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without\ndecomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value\nof integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep\nlearning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price\nforecasting and other nonstationary financial time series."}

Under review at IEEE TCSS", "summary": "Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them\na vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically\nunscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex\nform of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine\ntheir narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.\n  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant\nchallenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,\ntypically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to\ncapture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative\nframes. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing\npodcast narratives at scale.\n  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that\nexplicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the\nconversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our\napproach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with\nhigh-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions\nof this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely\naligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new\nanalysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being\ndiscussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a\nmore robust framework for studying influence in digital media."}

Deep reinforcement learning\noffers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent\nchallenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive\ndecision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep\nreinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The\narchitecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder\nand an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,\noptimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for\nfocusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration\nof global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded\nrepresentations to efficiently generate solution sequences.

In\nthis work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from\nshuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain\nwhere correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several\nLLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence\nalignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence\n(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects\nof ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with\nincreasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer\nprocedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,\ncorresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation.

Current training sample influence estimation\nmethods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing\ninformation flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order\ngradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of\nbillions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to\nsome subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal\nwork by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for\ncomputing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers\nare the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on\ninfluence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,\nwe propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the\ncancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better\nestimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of\naggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to\nstandard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to\nsignificantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for\nevaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model\nretraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)\nthat exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.\nThrough extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we\nconcretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than\nthe last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior\nknowledge in the field."}

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it\nremains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of\ntheir responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain\nsampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably\nwell-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain\nquestion-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base\nLLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own\ndistribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We\nstate three implications of this prediction, which we validate through\nexperiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across\nquestion-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this\ncalibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our\nknowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why\nsemantic calibration emerges in LLMs."}

This capability raises safety concerns as it may,\nfor example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during\nevaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such\nself-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it\nmanifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs\nwith low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably\ninduced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware\nbehavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation\nspace, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that\nself-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent\nrepresentations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral\nself-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily\ninduced and modulated."}

Yet,\nreal-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational\necosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,\nuse cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights\nthe need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic\nalignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse\nuser values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE\n(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'\ncapacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,\ninteractive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300\nrealistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic\nevaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral\nspecifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that\nleading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral\npolicies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their\ncompliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to\n84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and\nsafety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic\nbehavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions.

We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the\nweight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired\nbehavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this\ndirection to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate\nsycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often\ngeneralizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger\nout-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.\nWe also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering\ncan partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and\nunder-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance\ngains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can\nbe detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an\n\"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the\nevolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that\nnever manifest during training or evaluations."}
