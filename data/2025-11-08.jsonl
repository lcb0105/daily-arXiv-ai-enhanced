Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents.

We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily\nadjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and\nnarrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves\nan average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and\nGSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These\nresults highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking\nthe essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings."}

Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our\nframework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity\nto embracing cooperation in resolving queries.

Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style\nconformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and\n105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms\nbaseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on\nYouTube.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows."}

Existing approaches often rely on\nexternal knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,\naccessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is\nfragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy\nretrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce\nGraph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds\ngeneration in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a\nsparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small\nretrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved\nlogits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor\nhigh-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a\nrange of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic\nhallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,\nachieving up to 9.7$\\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\\%$ lower hallucination\nrates, and 6.9$\\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while\nattaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.\nGRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding\nand knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from\ncorpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more\ntruthful and verifiable outputs."}

Classical results of Gold showed that\nlanguage identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any\ninteresting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero."}

This capability is crucial for\nensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying\nwhether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining\nreliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often\nassess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook\nresidual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can\ncompromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND\n(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method\naiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify\nwhether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's\nloss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point\nevaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss\nlandscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile\npatterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods\nunder similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,\ndatasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world\ndeployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of\nunlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess\nunlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective\non memorization and unlearning."}

But this\nsimplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with\nricher, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,\nGRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a\npositive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.\n  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new\nformulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that\nenforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never\npositively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the\nbaseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the\nmodel to find optimal solutions rather than just \"acceptable\" ones.

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}
