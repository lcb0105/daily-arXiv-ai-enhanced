Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability.

However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system.

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Partial Path Reconstruction (PPR)\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u5408\u8def\u7531\u5206\u914d(JRA)\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u9879\u76ee-\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5bf9\u5f62\u6210\u7b80\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.00%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212(MIP)\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21JRA\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u7ea61%\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Partial Path Reconstruction (PPR)\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u9879\u76ee-\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5bf9\u5f62\u6210\u7b80\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u3002\u7ed3\u5408PJAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u65ad\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40Large-\u03b1\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728n=300\u3001500\u548c1000\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a0.00%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5408\u5e76\u89e3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPJAR\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86JRA\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728TSP\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines.

In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6(MoE)\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5b9a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u539f\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6(MoE)\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5b9a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ec4\u539f\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u5b9a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric.

Alexandropoulos"], "title": "Filtering Jump Markov Systems with Partially Known Dynamics: A Model-Based Deep Learning Approach", "comment": "Submitted to an IEEE transactions journal, copyright may be transfered upon acceptance", "summary": "This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge", "AI": {"tldr": "JMFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8df3\u53d8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2aRNN\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eKalmanNet\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8df3\u53d8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2aRNN\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4bRNN\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3aKalmanNet\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2RNN\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u6446\u89d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001Lorenz\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cJMFNet\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4KalmanNet\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "JMFNet\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8df3\u53d8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002"}}

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.", "AI": {"tldr": "TARG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u95e8\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77ed\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8349\u7a3f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77ed\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8349\u7a3f\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00\u5bf9\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u4ee4\u724c\u71b5\u3001top-1/top-2\u5bf9\u6570\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6216\u5c11\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u5c0fN\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728NQ-Open\u3001TriviaQA\u548cPopQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTARG\u76f8\u6bd4Always-RAG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8EM/F1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8670-90%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u63a5\u8fd1Never-RAG\u3002", "conclusion": "TARG\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLM\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5c0fN\u65b9\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u4f18\u5148\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u4efb\u4f55\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7b49\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u88ab\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u671f\u671b\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u7b49\u53d8\u5b9e\u73b0\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5373\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff08\u4e0e\u7fa4\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u603b\u662f\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u8bc4\u4f30\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728VRMSE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe37%\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1bML4PS\u793e\u533a\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5c06\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u521b\u5efa\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u5de8\u5927\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions.

The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations.

However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u62b5\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Rebellion\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4ARMs\u514d\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRebellion\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3ARMs\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "Rebellion\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "Rebellion\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions.

This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPAttention\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4eceH\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684O(N\u00b2)\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684O(N\u00b2)\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4eH\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u6838\u5fc3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O(H\u00b7N\u00b2)\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6362\u53d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u603b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e26\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u5206\u914d\u552f\u4e00\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5934\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728OLMoE-1B-7B\u548c0.25B-1.75B\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eLongformer\u3001Reformer\u548cBigBird\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPAttention\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity.

This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes.

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \\emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains.

The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion.

Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression.

We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it.

However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u70ed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u6297\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u81f4\u53d8\u8272\u67d3\u6599\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u52a0\u70ed\u5355\u5143\u5728\u8863\u7269\u8868\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u9ed8\u8ba4\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u4e3a\u666e\u901a\u9ed1\u8272T\u6064\uff0c\u52a0\u70ed\u540e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9690\u85cf\u5bf9\u6297\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8eb2\u907f\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u5916\u89c2\u663e\u773c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\u7684AI\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u70ed\u81f4\u53d8\u8272\u67d3\u6599\u4e0e\u67d4\u6027\u52a0\u70ed\u5355\u5143\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8863\u7269\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u70ed\u5355\u5143\u52a0\u70ed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u5bf9\u6297\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u572850\u79d2\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7eb9\u7406\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u630180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u53cdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728AI\u76d1\u63a7\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u6297\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55LLM\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5230646\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684KC\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u591a\u5197\u4f59KC\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6(KC)\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u662f\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59KC\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o-mini\u6269\u5c55\"\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\"\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5230646\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3cKC\u6807\u7b7e\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b(RMSE 0.4285 vs 0.4206)\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u591aKC(569 vs 101)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c0.8\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u5c06KC\u51cf\u5c11\u5230428\u4e2a\uff0cRMSE\u63d0\u5347\u52300.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KC\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI.

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks.

Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover.

Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6574\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u72ec\u7279\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b03\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "MCR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d85\u8fc7\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9MCR\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bb9\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "MCR\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u548c\u6574\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u590d\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u73b03\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c2.68\u500d\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MCR\u64cd\u4f5c\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u7801\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea7\u5d29\u6e83\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565SCD\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoft Constrained Decoding (SCD)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u6e29\u548c\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u671d\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCD\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework \"PustakAI\"\\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset \"NCERT-QA\" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic.

Version with Appendix", "summary": "We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes.

Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.\n  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency.

Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ChEmREF\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1035\u79cd\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523068.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9752.7%\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523063.9%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u83b7\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5371\u9669\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u67e5\u9605\u5927\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u6307\u5357\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u534f\u52a9\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6(ChEmREF)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u6307\u5357\u548cPubChem\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u76841035\u79cd\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523068.0%\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u6545\u54cd\u5e94\u5efa\u8bae\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f9752.7%\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523063.9%\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u534f\u52a9\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4eba\u5458\u5b8c\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\u03b7_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\u03b7_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.\n  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\u03b7/2$-rate nasty noise.

Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51cf\u5c11(DIR)\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba9\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a77\u5c3d\u91c7\u6837\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952etoken\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) hinter(\u5f3a\u5927LLM)\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2) practitioner(\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b)\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DIR\u6307\u6807\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548cMCTS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u89e3\u78011/5\u7684token\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4eFLOPs\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad85.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u534f\u52a9\u5ba1\u7a3f\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u8868\u683c\u6216\u56fe\u8868\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\uff08\u5c0f\u4e8e8B\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u5e94\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u89c6\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610f\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u6bd2\u5316\u826f\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5176\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u591a\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u6027\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610f\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u6bd2\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316GRPO\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u826f\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u6076\u610f\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u6c61\u67d3\u672c\u5730LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u8f7b\u677e\u6bd2\u5316\u826f\u6027\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u4ec550\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230100%\u7684\u963b\u6b62\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u3002"}}

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u62a5\u544a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u603b\u7ed3\u5370\u8c61\u5e76\u7cbe\u70bc\u5173\u952e\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRadFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u5956\u52b1\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u9762\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5370\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5c40\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u5f3a\u8c03\u5370\u8c61\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u8303\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u548c\u9888\u52a8\u8109\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRadFlow\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RadFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u53c8\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants.

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task.

In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines.

To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct \"what-if\" analyses across different models.

In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\\ell)$, where $i\\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\\ell\\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \\textit{feasible} arm with the \\textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-\u03b4$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \\textit{asymptotically ($\u03b4\\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u81c2\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u989d\u5916\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u6eb6\u89e3\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u836f\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u5f00\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u81c2\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6216\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u81c2\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684BAI\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5e26\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u5f00\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining \"contrastive reindexing\" for inter-class isolation and \"constrained cascade generation\" for intra-class protection.

(2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DenoGrad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "DenoGrad\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cDenoGrad\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DenoGrad\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics.

A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems.

Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\u03b3$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\\log(1/\u03b3))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).\n  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\u03b3)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.\n  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most \"suspicious\" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs).

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "VocalNet-M2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7801\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5c06\u9996\u5757\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece\u7ea6725ms\u51cf\u5c11\u5230350ms\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVocalNet-M2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u7801\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7801\u672c\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVocalNet-M2\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u9996\u5757\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u4ece\u7ea6725ms\u5230350ms\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u7801\u672c\u548c\u591a\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002"}}

Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoReal\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548cLLM\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548cLLM\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3NCO\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728TSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f31.05%\u548c2.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoReal\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question.

Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines.

Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications.

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08UGCS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u5747\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost.

This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATR4CH\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u7684LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bba\u8ff0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548cLLM\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4e94\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6ce8\u91ca\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u6784\u5efa\u987a\u5e8f\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6F1 0.96-0.99\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522bF1 0.7-0.8\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u53d6F1 0.65-0.75\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u63d0\u53d6F1 0.95-0.97\uff0c\u8bba\u8ff0\u8868\u793aG-EVAL 0.62\u3002\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u8c03LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm.

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TruthfulRAG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u71b5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eLLMs\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728token\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "TruthfulRAG\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "SE-Diff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ODE\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u578b\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u504f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "SE-Diff\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ODE\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u62cd\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6ce8\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSE-Diff\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u672c-ECG\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e5f\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "SE-Diff\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eBAE*\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6b21\u4f18\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6307\u5b9a\u89e3\u6210\u672c\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u754c\u9650\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u5411\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6709\u754c\u6b21\u4f18\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u6b21\u4f18\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5BAE*\uff08\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u754c\u6b21\u4f18\u573a\u666f\u7684BAE*\u53d8\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u754c\u6b21\u4f18\u53cc\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u52a0\u6743A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u6b21\u4f18\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7b49\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u4ea7\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6216\u65e0\u6548\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ea\u662f\u7b26\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5076\u7136\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a(a)\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff1b(b)\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters.

We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.\n  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7ef4\u5ea6\u83b7\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec4\u5408K_d\u4e2a\u81ea\u6d3d\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0O(n^{-1/d})\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u3002\u5728\u989d\u5916\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u903c\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u505a\u5230\u4e0e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "FactGuard\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u624b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u9010\u6e10\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u63a2\u7d22\u6d45\u5c42\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFactGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5f97\u5230FactGuard-D\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548cLLM\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "FactGuard\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features.

However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk \"repairing\" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "M\u00b2V-UGAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b\u91c7\u6837\u7f13\u89e3\u63d2\u8865\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u5f02\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u4f7f\u5176\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u76f8\u4e92\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b63\u5e38\u8282\u70b9\u5360\u636e\u7d27\u51d1\u5185\u6d41\u5f62\u800c\u5f02\u5e38\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5916\u58f3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5916\u90e8\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u751f\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b\u6765\u9510\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM\u00b2V-UGAD\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u503c\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u63d2\u8865\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3LLMs\uff08\u5982GPT-4\u548cLlama3\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u673a\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8ddf\u8e2a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3LLMs\uff08GPT-4\u548cLlama3\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u540e\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase.

User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u6458\u8981\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u6458\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6355\u6349\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316MARL\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684When\u3001Why Not\u548cWhat\u7c7b\u578b\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aMARL\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316MARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7b49\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions.

We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdvancedIF\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cRIFL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRIFL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "RIFL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728AdvancedIF\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f976.7%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u5219\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted.

However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations.

We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u7528\u6237\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u52a9\u624b\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u5f03\u6743\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9690\u542b\u8fde\u63a5\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6d88\u606f\u8bc1\u636e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523070-82%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523030-45%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u524d30\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c150\u6b21\u5185\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u6b64\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u6df7\u5408\u6216RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u503c\u5f97\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5c06\u901a\u7528RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u3002"}}

Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection.

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u4f53\u88c1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u4ee3\u6587\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5c0f\u8bf4\uff08\u8a00\u60c5\u3001\u60ac\u7591\u3001\u79d1\u5e7b\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4f53\u88c1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u800c\u975e\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4e0e\u7c7b\u578b\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Welch's ANOVA\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u4f53\u88c1\u5185\u548c\u4f53\u88c1\u95f4\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f53\u88c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u90fd\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f53\u88c1\u786e\u5b9e\u5177\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u5728\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b66\u8ba4\u53ef\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u7a84\u548c\u66f4\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart.

This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphSB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u6210\u524d\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6269\u6563\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GNN\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u6210\u6216\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u540c\u5316\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphSB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff1a1) \u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a - \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u8fb9\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff1b2) \u5173\u7cfb\u6269\u6563 - \u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u540c\u65f6\u653e\u5927\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGraphSB\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u73873.67%\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphSB\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e00\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural \"language\". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as \"structural synonyms\". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple \"synonym swap\" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models.

In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u6765\u8bef\u5bfc\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u9a8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u3001\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u3001DeepLIFT SHAP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u503c\u5f97\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u79cd\u65cf\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u62a4\u7406\u7c7b\u804c\u4e1a\u88ab\u5973\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u7b49\u804c\u4e1a\u5219\u88ab\u767d\u4eba\u548c\u7537\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u590d\u5236\u548c\u653e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5341\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6027\u804c\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u804c\u4e1a100\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u51715000\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u62a4\u7406\u89d2\u8272\u88ab\u6301\u7eed\u5973\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb6\u3001\u533b\u751f\u548c\u5f8b\u5e08\u7b49\u9ad8\u5730\u4f4d\u804c\u4e1a\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7531\u767d\u4eba\u548c\u7537\u6027\u4ee3\u8868\u3002\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982QWEN-Image\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u4e1c\u4e9a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0cKandinsky\u4e3b\u5bfc\u767d\u4eba\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0cSDXL\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u5e7f\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3aAI\u9879\u76ee\u7ecf\u7406\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u5e73\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u539f\u5219\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u751f\u6210AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis.

This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics.

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets.

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work.

Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u548cgumbel-softmax\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u58f0\u5b66\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u7269\u53d1\u58f0\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u7269\u53d1\u58f0\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u53d1\u58f0\u5185\u90e8\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528HuBERT\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLevenshtein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684k-\u8fd1\u90bb\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u56db\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u547c\u53eb\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u547c\u53eb\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u547c\u53eb\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u547c\u53eb\u8005\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u7269\u53d1\u58f0\u4e2d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models.

Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\u00e9vy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states.

This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution.

More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCure\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5.1\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8f6c\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ec4\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4f20\u7edf\u4e91-\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "FedCure\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff1a(1)\u504f\u597d\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u96c6\u4f53\u5229\u76ca\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u533a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u76df\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u975eIID\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b(2)\u8c03\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u5c06\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u76df\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff1b(3)\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u76df\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefCPU\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCure\u76f8\u6bd4\u56db\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u6700\u4f4e\u4e3a0.0223\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCure\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust.

Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making.

Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \\textbf{ITE} estimation (\\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation.

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively.

Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information.

However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership.

However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines.

To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead.

In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \\text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHolonorm\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Tanh\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5931\u771f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684Dynamic Tanh\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Tanh\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46Tanh\u672c\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHolonorm\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "Holonorm\u80fd\u591f\u9632\u6b62\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a0\u52301\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "Holonorm\u662fsoftsign\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u91cd\u8981\u539f\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u91cd\u8981\u539f\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5305\u542b\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAP-20\u3001TM23\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cColabFit\u768464\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u7559\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u91cd\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MSC\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MLIP\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u6e90QUESTS\u5305\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MLIP\u3002"}}
