Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference.

Classical deep generative models often struggle to\ncapture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or\nproducing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the\nQuantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework\nthat integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.\nThe framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that\njointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)\nquantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and\nmitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical\nparameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are\noptimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic\nGaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and\nprotein structure.

The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes).

To get around the\nconstraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack\ndynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then\nshow that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial\nimprovement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87\nto 0.41 using our scaffold."}

Benchmarked on\nBhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source\ninstruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also\ndemonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger\nmodels. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain\nadaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally\ncongruent AI for specialized medical knowledge."}

A clipping function\nis introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio\nin these \"right\" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to\nextend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering\nthe clipping in the \"right\" direction regions.

However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address.

To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency.

However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model.

Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling\nand semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling\nhuman-centric decisions.

Current studies have\nproposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation\nfor embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by\nleveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly\ntrained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,\nshowing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial\nembedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for\nsome queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal\nenvironments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal\nmultimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not.

However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually."}
