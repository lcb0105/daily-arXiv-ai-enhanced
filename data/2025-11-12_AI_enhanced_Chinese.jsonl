However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks.

Nguyen"], "title": "Towards Personalized Quantum Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection", "comment": "Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering", "summary": "Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions.

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time.

Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism.

Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens.

A Unifying Framework for Fairness, Robustness, and Distribution Shift", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\u03b1$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+\u03b1)/(1-\u03b1)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains.

While traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern have served as foundational instruments, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise enhanced context understanding. We evaluated three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, and GEITje-7B-ultra) against LIWC and Pattern for valence prediction in Flemish, a low-resource language variant. Our dataset comprised approximately 25000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants, each providing narratives about their current experiences with self-assessed valence ratings (-50 to +50). Surprisingly, despite architectural advancements, the Dutch-tuned LLMs underperformed compared to traditional methods, with Pattern showing superior performance. These findings challenge assumptions about LLM superiority in sentiment analysis tasks and highlight the complexity of capturing emotional valence in spontaneous, real-world narratives.

In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCAPO\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3DPO\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DPO\uff09\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u6bd4\u8f83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CAPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u6bd4\u8f83\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAPO\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u534716%\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u9996\u9009\u548c\u975e\u9996\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u6bd4\u8f83\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u4e2d\u8bcd\u6c47\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5bf9\u8bcd\u957f\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u8bcd\u6c47\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u524d\u6587\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u5df2\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed9\u5b9a\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u672a\u6765\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5bf9\u8bcd\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6697\u793a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u5883\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseRM\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3LLM\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6355\u83b7\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5956\u52b1\u5934\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u597d\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSparseRM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseRM\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Adhering to the principles of \"quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation,\" the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection. Finally, the paper looks forward to the future iteration direction of the evaluation benchmark and the core development direction of \"domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement\" for insurance large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CUFEInse v1.0\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u5782\u76f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u4ea7\u4e1a\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\"\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\"\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b5\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u300154\u4e2a\u5b50\u6307\u6807\u300114,430\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4fdd\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u5171\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u5782\u76f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u677f\uff1b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u7cbe\u7b97\u3001\u6838\u4fdd\u7406\u8d54\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u8425\u9500\u6587\u6848\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5171\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "CUFEInse\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6743\u5a01\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u4fdd\u9669\u5927\u6a21\u578b\"\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d+\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\"\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets.

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights.

A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u5c42\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u6218\u7565\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u9690\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u793a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment.

This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u548c\u5361\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0delta-theta-alpha\u632f\u8361\u534f\u8c03\u53c2\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u77ed\u671f\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5219\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5361\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u523a\u6fc0\u9501\u5b9a\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u9501\u5b9a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u7684delta-theta-alpha\u52a8\u6001\uff1a\u65e9\u671fdelta-theta\u6d3b\u52a8\u53cd\u6620\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u6795\u53f6alpha\u53c2\u4e0e\u8868\u660e\u6210\u529f\u89c4\u5219\u8bc6\u522b\u540e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u786e\u8ba4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u77ed\u671f\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c42\u6b21\u89c4\u5219\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u632f\u8361\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\\varepsilon\\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5MURAG\u548cMURAG-ADA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5f53\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u672a\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aMURAG\u5229\u7528\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7d2f\u79ef\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u88ab\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u9891\u7387\u800c\u975e\u67e5\u8be2\u603b\u6570\uff1bMURAG-ADA\u901a\u8fc7\u79c1\u6709\u53d1\u5e03\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u7528DP\u9884\u7b97\uff08\u03b5\u224810\uff09\u5185\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1RAG\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches.

Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events.

The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1).

To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage. This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts.

However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \\textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \\textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \\textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs.

This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%).

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TimeFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(SDE)\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u666e\u901a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(ODE)\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTimeFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SDE-based\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408encoder-only\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6765\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u9879\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTimeFlow\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SDE-based\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Uncertainty estimation, often using predictive entropy estimation, is key to addressing this issue.

This paper proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method that approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-$K$ probabilities. Moreover, we employ an adaptive mechanism to determine $K$ to enhance flexibility and filter out low-confidence probabilities.

Nevertheless, tasks derived from work-related contexts inherently reflect real-world complexities, characterized by long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and scarce data availability. The rise of generalist embedding models prompts the question of their performance in the work domain, especially as progress in the field has focused mainly on individual tasks. To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets.

Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOTAM-Evolve\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u89e3\u51b3NOTAM\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u638c\u63e1\u590d\u6742NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "NOTAM\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\u90fd\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u60c5\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNOTAM-Evolve\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eNOTAM-Evolve\u5728\u57fa\u7840LLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630.4%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NOTAM\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u84b8\u998f\uff08SCD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff08EPM\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u84b8\u998f\uff08SCD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff08EPM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c3\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCD\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\uff088B\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1GPT4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u914d\u5907EPM\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6EPM\u673a\u5236\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-SAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5206\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5176\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u9644\u8fd1\u548c\u8fdc\u5904\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-SAM\u5728RMSE\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534717%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u6d6e\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u677f\u8f66\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u8f66\u8f86\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u55848.44%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u6d6e\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5404\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u7528\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b3. \u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u55848.44%\uff0cMIP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6539\u558419.6%\u3002\u6839\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea63%-10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u7531\u6d6e\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002"}}

We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u56de\u62a5\u62df\u5408\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3AI\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7684GCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u56de\u62a5\u62df\u5408\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u8fbe4000\u6b65\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\uff08Bridge\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u7f1d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u7f1d\u5408\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefGCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684VSPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u672c\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u9519\u8bef\u7684CQs\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4GPT-4.1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad826%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u9ad828.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684CQ\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\uff08\u5982\"Misusing allValuesFrom\"\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u516c\u7406\u6216\u6539\u53d8\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u5f15\u5165\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u7684CQs\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684CQs\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9677\u9631\u9a8c\u8bc1CQs\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4GPT-4.1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad826%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u9ad828.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210TBox\u9a8c\u8bc1CQs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u672c\u4f53\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u9488\u5bf9CQ\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions.

This \"black box\" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

We make three core contributions: i) we present a topic modeling method, Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), that has identifiable and recoverable parameter guarantees and sample complexity guarantees for large data; ii) we show that this method is computationally and memory efficient (achieving speeds over 3-4x those of prior parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods), and that it scales linearly to text datasets with over a billion documents; iii) we provide an open-source, GPU-based implementation, of this method. This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge.

This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration.

(2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation.

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores.

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types.

A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \\emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \\emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC. Then, we empirically analyze the behavior of both optimizers across multiple privacy budgets ($\u03b5= 1, 3, 7$). We find that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers like DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC, scoring over 15\\% higher on text classification, up to 5\\% higher on image classification, and consistently 1\\% higher on graph node classification.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0bLLM\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f3049\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u57285\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5185\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6548\u7387\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6548\u7387\u5728LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7600\u7bc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u7167\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u66ff\u6362\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6559\u5e08\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u76ee\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5176\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AES 2.0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684600\u7bc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1a(i)\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c(ii)\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u4f5c\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u64cd\u7eb5\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7537\u6027-\u5973\u6027\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6bd4\u5973\u6027-\u7537\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u53ea\u6709GPT\u548cLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u516c\u5e73\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6307\u5357\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u91cd\u6784\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7206\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Submitted to the Journal of Risk and Insurance (JRI), November 2025", "summary": "This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e94\u5927\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ba1\u614e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06Solvency II\u3001SR 11-7\u7b49\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u65bd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65cf\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u7eb3\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHamilton-Jacobi\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u8fbe\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHamilton-Jacobi\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u503c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u9075\u5faa\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u6240\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684HJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u8fbe\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHamilton-Jacobi\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ParliaBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\u548cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u515a\u6d3e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ParliaBench\u4e3a\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u653f\u6cbb\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed.

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization.

Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task.

Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making.

After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $\u03c0$-noise generators. We validate Rectified Noise by conducting extensive experiments across various model architectures on different datasets. Notably, we find that: (1) RF models using Rectified Noise reduce FID from \\textbf{10.16 to 9.05} on ImageNet-1k.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7684LLM\u54cd\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4eba\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers.

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods.

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error.

However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning.

Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools.

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains.

We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success.

Experiments on standard LLM benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence, while cutting peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared with MeZO-Adam.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOREN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548cREINFORCE\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "LOREN\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6355\u6349\u66f2\u7387\uff1b\u5e94\u7528REINFORCE\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLOREN\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0eMeZO-Adam\u76f8\u6bd4\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8627.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "LOREN\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information.

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning.

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff08STV\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u654f\u611f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u503c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ecd\u7136\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5408\u9002\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u8bc6\u522b\u654f\u611f\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e93\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen-VL\u3001Idefics-2\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982VizWiz\u3001OK-VQA\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30STV\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "STV\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08R-DFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08S-DFL\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08S-DFL\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08R-DFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdbR-DFL\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u62a5\u7ae5\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cR-DFL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "R-DFL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current datasets and methods are highly focused on cases where only a small part of the corpus (usually a few paragraphs) is relevant per query, and fail to capture the rich world of aggregative queries. These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP.

However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building.

This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiagramIR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLaTeX TikZ\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4LLM-as-a-Judge\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ee510\u500d\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5de5\u5177\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiagramIR\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eLaTeX TikZ\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08IRs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eLLM-as-a-Judge\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDiagramIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fGPT-4.1-Mini\u7b49\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ee510\u500d\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eGPT-5\u7b49\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DiagramIR\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored. When the noise covariance is unknown, we show that the optimal regret rate becomes of order $T^{2/3}$ (ignoring log factors).

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.\n  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spark\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u793e\u533a\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba9AI\u7f16\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u4f53\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5230\u4ee5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6c\u578b\u6b63\u5728\u7834\u574f\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6e90\u5e93\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Spark\u5171\u4eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u7f16\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6559\u7ec3\uff0c\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002", "result": "Spark\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u5c42\u7ea7\u901a\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a300\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728Spark\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u4e24\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u7ea7\u8fbe\u523098.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "Spark\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u7f16\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4f53\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules.

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u6216\u4e0d\u591f\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8a00\u8bed\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0eLLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoME\u76d1\u63a7\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8a00\u8bed\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MoME\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u5728AI\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8a00\u8bed\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0cMoME\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors.

In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal.

Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790MuJoCo Playground\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u5c40\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e2\u80fd\u6a21\u4eff\u6f14\u793a\u53c8\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u826f\u6216\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9690\u542b\u4f20\u8fbe\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u662f\u5426\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6210\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u867d\u7136\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u5173\u7cfb\u5230AI\u80fd\u5426\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u601d\u7ef4\u4f19\u4f34\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u5927\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u624d\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u7ef4\u4f19\u4f34\u3002"}}

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BIPPO\uff08\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u539f\u751f\u8003\u8651\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u6d41\u5931\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "BIPPO\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBIPPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4f20\u7edfPPO\u548cIPPO\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u6d88\u8017\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u7b97\u6d88\u8017\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "BIPPO\u4e3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other.

We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods.

However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking.

A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3BoN\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "BoN\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u4ecd\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6279\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u9884\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u96c6\u6240\u8de8\u8d8a\u603b\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ece\u66fc\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347BoN\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error.

The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy.

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLPPG-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168RL\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLPPG-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Dykstra\u6295\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22\u9632\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u5bfc\u822a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLPPG-RL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fde\u7eedLMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "LPPG-RL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u517c\u5bb9\u7684LMORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \\textit{global stability}, \\textit{phase sensitivity}, and \\textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\\% in MSE and 5.15\\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting.

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution.

In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \\emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.\n  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \\emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \\emph{direct} and \\emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.\n  Furthermore, we establish a general \\emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure.

Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\\% with a ViT-H/14.

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u8868\u9762\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RLVR\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6cbf\u7740\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800cSFT\u5219\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6743\u91cd\u5e76\u626d\u66f2\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0eSFT\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u95f8\u95e8\u7406\u8bba\uff1a\u95f8\u95e8I\uff08KL\u951a\u70b9\uff09\u65bd\u52a0KL\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u95f8\u95e8II\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u5c06\u6b65\u957f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5230\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u8c31\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u95f8\u95e8III\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u5728\u975e\u504f\u597d\u533a\u57df\u9690\u85cf\u5fae\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u3002SFT\u5219\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u626d\u66f2\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u843d\u540e\u4e8eRLVR\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u4e0eSFT\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u91c7\u7528SFT\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u767d\u76d2\u7406\u89e3RLVR\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684RLVR\u539f\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
